<small>THE GIRL WITH THE YACHT</small></h2>


<p>Perhaps they call them "parlor" cars because
they bear so little resemblance to the traditional
parlor&mdash;a word and a room now sadly out of
style. In reality they are ordinary cars with two
rows of swivel seats down the center; seats supposed
to pivot in every direction unless their
action is impeded by the passenger's hand baggage,
which the porter promptly piles around the
chairs, leaving one barely room to place his feet
and no chance at all to swing the seat. Thus imprisoned,
you ride thoughtfully on your way, wondering
if the exclusive "parlor car" is really
worth the extra fee.</p>

<p>However, those going to San Diego, in the
Southland of California, are obliged to choose
between plebeian coaches and the so-called "parlor"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>outfit, and on a mild, sunny morning in February
the San Diego train rolled out of the Los
Angeles depot with every swivel seat in the car
de luxe occupied by a passenger.</p>

<p>They were a mixed assemblage, mostly tourists
bound for Colorado, yet quite unknown to one
another; or, at least, not on speaking terms.
There was a Spanish-looking gentleman in white;
two prim, elderly damsels in black; a mamma with
three subdued children and a maid, and a fat
man who read a book and scowled at every neighbor
who ventured a remark louder than a whisper.
Forward in the car the first three seats were
taken by a party from New York, and this little
group of travelers attracted more than one curious
glance.</p>

<p>"That," murmured one of the prim ladies to
the other, "is Madeline Dentry, the famous heiress.
No one knows how many millions she has
just inherited, but she is said to be one of the richest
girls in America. The stout lady is her chaperon;
I believe&mdash;she's a distant relative&mdash;an aunt,
or something&mdash;and the thin, nervous man, the
stout lady's husband, is Madeline Dentry's financial
manager."</p>

<p>"I know," replied the other, nodding; "he used
to be her guardian before she came of legal age,
a month or so ago. His name is Tupper&mdash;Martin
J. Tupper&mdash;and I'm told he is well connected."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is, indeed, to have the handling of Madeline's
millions."</p>

<p>"I mean in a family way. The Dentrys were
nobodies, you know, until Madeline's father cornered
the mica mines of the world and made his
millions; but the Tuppers were a grand old Baltimore
family in the days of Washington, always
poor as poverty and eminently aristocratic."</p>

<p>"Do you know the Tuppers?"</p>

<p>"I have never met them. I strongly disapprove
of their close association with Miss Dentry&mdash;a
fly-away miss who kept Bryn Mawr in a turmoil
while she was a student there, and is now
making an absurd use of her money."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard? She has purchased Lord
Tweedmonk's magnificent yacht, and has had it
taken to San Diego harbor. I was told by the
bell boy at the Los Angeles Hotel&mdash;bell boys are
singularly well-informed, I have observed&mdash;that
Madeline Dentry is to take her new yacht on a
cruise to Hawaii and Japan. She is probably
now on her way to see her extravagant and foolish
plaything."</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" said the other, with a shudder.
"I wonder how anyone can squander a fortune
on a yacht when all those poor heathens are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
starving in China. What a pity the girl has no
mother to guide her!"</p>

<p>"Tell me about the beautiful girl seated next
to Madeline."</p>

<p>"I do not know who she is. Some stranger to
the rich young lady, I imagine. They're not
speaking. Yes, she is really beautiful, that girl.
Her eyes are wonderful, and her coloring perfect."</p>

<p>"And she seems so modest and diffident."</p>

<p>"Evidence of good breeding, whoever she may
be; quite the opposite of Madeline Dentry, whose
people have always been rapid and rude."</p>

<p>The fat gentleman was now glaring at the old
ladies so ferociously that they became awed and
relapsed into silence. The others in the car seemed
moodily reserved. Mr. Martin J. Tupper read a
newspaper. His stolid wife, seated beside him,
closed her eyes and napped. Madeline Dentry,
abandoning a book that was not interesting,
turned a casual glance upon her neighbor in the
next chair&mdash;the beautiful girl who had won the
approval of the two old maids. Madeline herself
had a piquant, attractive countenance, but her
neighbor was gazing dreamily out of the window
and seemed not to have noticed her. In this listless
attitude she might be inspected at leisure,
and Madeline was astonished at the perfect profile,
the sheen of her magnificent hair, the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
warm tintings of a skin innocent of powders or
cosmetics. Critically the rich young lady glanced
at the girl's attire. It was exceedingly simple
but of costly material. She wore no jewels or
ornaments, nor did she need them to enhance her
attractiveness.</p>

<p>Perhaps feeling herself under observation, the
girl slowly turned her head until her eyes met
those of Madeline. They were gloriously blue
eyes, calm and intelligent, wide open and fearless.
Yet with a faint smile she quickly withdrew them
before Madeline's earnest gaze.</p>

<p>"Will you have a chocolate?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>The strong hand with its well-shaped fingers
did not fumble in Madeline's box of bonbons. She
took a chocolate, smiled again, and with a half
shy glance into her neighbor's face proceeded to
nibble the confection.</p>

<p>Madeline was charmed.</p>

<p>"Are you traveling alone?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am to meet my brother and&mdash;some
friends&mdash;in San Diego."</p>

<p>"I am Miss Dentry&mdash;Madeline Dentry. My
home is in New York."</p>

<p>"And mine is in Los Angeles. I am not straying
very far away, you see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Madeline was piqued that her hint was disregarded.</p>

<p>"And your name!" she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated an instant. Then she said:
"I am Miss Kane."</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper looked up from his newspaper.</p>

<p>"Kane?" he repeated. "Bless me! That's the
name of the Flying Girl."</p>

<p>"So it is," admitted Miss Kane, with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>"But flying is not in your line, I imagine," said
Madeline, admiring anew the dainty personality
of her chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>"At present our train is dragging, rather than
flying," was the merry response.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper was interested. He carefully folded
his paper and joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>"The idea of any girl attempting to do stunts
in the air!" he remarked disdainfully. "Your
namesake, Miss Kane, deserves to break her venturesome,
unmaidenly neck&mdash;as she probably will,
in the near future."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Uncle!" cried Madeline; "Orissa
Kane, so far as I've read of her&mdash;and I've read
everything I could find&mdash;is not at all unmaidenly.
She's venturesome, if you like, and manages an
a&euml;roplane better than many of the bird-men can;
but I see nothing more unwomanly in flying than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in running an automobile, and you know <i>I</i> do that
to perfection. This Flying Girl, as she is called,
is famous all over America for her daring, her
coolness in emergencies and her exceptional skill.
I want to see her fly, while I'm out here, for I
understand there's to be an aviation meet of some
sort in San Diego next week, and that Orissa
Kane is engaged to take part in it."</p>

<p>"Flying is good sport, I admit," said Mr. Tupper,
"but it would give me the shivers to see a
girl attempt it. And, once a machine is in the air,
you can't tell whether a man or woman is flying it;
they all look alike to the watcher below. Don't
go to this aviation meet, Madeline; you've seen
girls fly. There was Miss Moissant, at Garden
City&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She barely got off the ground," said Miss
Dentry.</p>

<p>"And there was Blanche Scott&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're all imitators of Orissa Kane!" declared
Madeline impatiently. "There's only one
real Flying Girl, Uncle, and if she's on the program
at the San Diego meet I'm going to see her."</p>

<p>"You'll be disappointed," averred the gentleman.
"She's a native of these parts, they say;
I presume some big-boned, masculine, orange-picking
female&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wrong again, sir! The reporters all rave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
about her. They say she has a charming personality,
is lovely and sweet and modest and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused, her eyes dilating a little
as she marked the red flush creeping over Miss
Kane's neck and face. Then Madeline drew in
her breath sharply and cast a warning glance at
her uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper, however, was obtuse. He knew
nothing of Madeline's suspicions.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen this dare-devil namesake
of yours, Miss Kane?" he asked indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she answered in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"And what did you think of her?"</p>

<p>Madeline was powerless to stop him. Miss
Kane, however, looked at her questioner with candid
eyes, a frank smile upon her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"She has a fine a&euml;roplane," was her reply.
"Her brother invented it, you know. It's the
Kane Aircraft, the safest and speediest yet made,
and Stephen Kane has taught his sister how to
handle it. That she flies his Aircraft successfully
is due, I am sure, to her brother's genius; not to
any especial merit of her own."</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper was staring now, and beginning to
think. He remembered reading a similar assertion
attributed to Orissa Kane, the Flying Girl,
who always insisted on crediting her brother with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
whatever success she achieved. Perhaps this girl
had read it, too; or, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He began to "put two and two together."
Southern California was the favorite haunt of the
Flying Girl; there was to be an aviation meet presently
at San Diego; and on this train, bound for
San Diego, was riding a certain Miss Kane who
answered to Madeline's description of the a&euml;rial
heroine&mdash;a description he now remembered to
have often read himself. Uncertain what to say,
he asked haltingly:</p>

<p>"Do you call it 'aviatrix' or 'aviatrice'? The
feminine of 'aviator,' you know."</p>

<p>"I should say 'aviatress,' now that you appeal
to me," was the laughing reply. "Some of the
newspaper men, who love to coin new words, have
tried to saddle 'aviatrice' on the girl aviator, and
the French have dubbed her 'aviatrix' without
rhyme or reason. It seems to me that if 'seamstress,'
'governess' or 'hostess' is proper, 'aviatress'
is also correct and, moreover, it is thoroughly
American. But in&mdash;in the profession&mdash;on
the aviation field&mdash;they call themselves 'aviators,'
whether men or women, just as an author is always
an 'author,' regardless of sex."</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper had made up his mind, by this time.
He reasoned that a girl who talked so professionally
of aviation terms must be something more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
than a novice, and straggled to remember if he
had inadvertently said anything to annoy or
humiliate Miss Kane. For, if the little maid so
demurely seated before him was indeed the famous
Flying Girl, the gentleman admitted he had good
reason to admire her. Madeline was watching
his embarrassment with an expression of amusement,
but would not help him out of his dilemma.
So Mr. Tupper went straight to the heart of the
misunderstanding, as perhaps was best under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Your first name is Orissa?" he inquired,
gently.</p>

<p>"It is, sir."</p>

<p>"Won't you have another chocolate!" asked
Madeline.</p>

<p>Orissa took another chocolate, reflecting how
impossible it seemed to hide her identity, even
from utter strangers. Not that she regretted, in
any way, the celebrity she had gained by flying
her brother Stephen's Aircraft, but it would have
been so nice to have ridden to-day with these
pleasant people without listening to the perfunctory
words of praise and adulation so persistently
lavished upon her since she had acquired fame.</p>

<p>"I knew Cumberford some years ago," continued
Mr. Tupper, rather aimlessly. "Cumberford's
your manager, I believe!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and my brother's partner."</p>

<p>"Good chap, Cumberford. Had a queer daughter,
I remember; an impossible child, with the
airs of a princess and the eyes of a sorceress.
She's grown up, by this time, I suppose."</p>

<p>Miss Kane smiled.</p>

<p>"Sybil Cumberford is my best chum," she
replied. "The description still applies, so far as
the airs and eyes are concerned; but the child is
a young lady now, and a very lovable young lady,
her friends think."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, doubtless," Mr. Tupper said
hastily. "If Cumberford is in San Diego I shall
be glad to renew our acquaintance."</p>

<p>"You are bound for Coronado, I suppose,"
remarked Orissa, to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Only for a few days' stay," Madeline
answered. "Then we expect to make a sea
voyage to Honolulu."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful," said the girl. "I've
lived many years on the shores of the Pacific, but
have never made a voyage farther to sea than
Catalina. I'm told Honolulu is a fascinating
place; but it needs be to draw one away from
Coronado."</p>

<p>"You like Coronado, then?"</p>

<p>"All this South Country is a real paradise,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>declared Orissa. "I have had opportunity to compare
it with other parts of America, and love it
better after each comparison. But I am ignorant
of foreign countries, and can only say that if they
excel Southern California they are too good for
humans to live in and ought to be sacred to the
fairies."</p>

<p>Madeline laughed gayly.</p>

<p>"I know you now!" she exclaimed; "you are
what is called out here a 'booster.' But from my
limited experience in your earthly paradise I cannot
blame you."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all 'boosters,'" asserted the
younger girl, "and I'm positive you will join our
ranks presently. I love this country especially
because one can fly here winter and summer."</p>

<p>"You are fond of flying?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At first I didn't care very much for it,
but it grows on one until its fascinations are irresistible.
I have the most glorious sense of freedom
when I'm in the air&mdash;way up, where I love
best to be&mdash;but during my recent exhibitions in
the East I nearly froze making the high flights. It
is a little cold even here when you are half a mile
up, but it is by no means unbearable."</p>

<p>"They call you a 'dare-devil,' in the newspapers,"
remarked Mr. Tupper, eyeing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>reflectively; "but I can scarcely believe one so&mdash;so
young and&mdash;and&mdash;girlish has ventured to do
all the foolish a&euml;rial tricks you are credited with."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tupper had by this time opened her eyes
and was now listening in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," she added, reprovingly, "all those spiral
dips and volplaning and&mdash;and&mdash;figure-eights are
more suited to a circus performer than to a young
girl, it seems to me."</p>

<p>This lady's face persistently wore a bland and
unmeaning smile, which had been so carefully cultivated
in her youth that it had become habitual
and wreathed her chubby features even when she
was asleep, giving one the impression that she
wore a mask. Now her stern eyes belied the
smirk of her face, but Orissa merely smiled.</p>

<p>"I am not a 'dare-devil,' I assure you," she
said, addressing Mr. Tupper rather than his wife.
"I know the newspapers call me that, and compare
me with the witch on a broomstick; but in
truth I am as calculating and cold as any aviator
in America. Everything I do is figured out with
mathematical precision and I never take a single
chance that I can foresee. I know the air currents,
and all their whims and peculiarities, and
how to counteract them. What may seem to the
spectators to be daring, and even desperate, is
often the safest mode of flying, provided you
understand your machine and the conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the air. To volplane from a height of five or ten
thousand feet, for example, is safer than from a
slight elevation, for the further you drop the better
air-cushion is formed under your planes, and
you ride as gently as when suspended from a
parachute."</p>

<p>Madeline was listening eagerly.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Afraid? Why should I be, with my brother's
wonderful engine at my back and perfect control
of every part of my machine?"</p>

<p>"Suppose the engine should some time fail
you?"</p>

<p>"Then I would volplane to the ground."</p>

<p>"And if the planes, or braces, or fastenings
break?"</p>

<p>"No fear of that. The Kane Aircraft is strong
enough for any a&euml;rial purpose and I examine
every brace and strut before I start my fight&mdash;merely
to satisfy myself they have not been
maliciously tampered with."</p>

<p>Then Madeline sprung her important question:</p>

<p>"Do you ever take a passenger?"</p>

<p>Orissa regarded Miss Dentry with a whimsical
smile.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said. "Do you imagine you
would like to fly?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, indeed!" cried Mr. Tupper in a horrified
voice, and Mrs. Tupper echoed; "How
absurd!" But Madeline answered quietly:</p>

<p>"If you could manage to take me I am sure I
would enjoy the experience."</p>

<p>"I will consider it and let you know later," said
the Flying Girl, thoughtfully. "My chum, Sybil
Cumberford, has made several short flights with
me; but Sybil's head is perfectly balanced and no
altitude affects it. Often those who believe they
would enjoy flying become terrified once they are
in the air."</p>

<p>"Nothing could terrify Madeline, I am sure,"
asserted Mrs. Tupper, in a rasping voice; "but
she is too important a personage to risk her life
foolishly. I shall insist that she at once abandon
the preposterous idea. Abandon it, Madeline! I
thought your new yacht a venturesome thing to
indulge in, but flying is far, far worse."</p>

<p>"Oh; have you a yacht?" inquired Orissa, turning
eagerly to the other girl.</p>

<p>"Yes; the <i>Salvador</i>. It is now lying in San
Diego harbor. I've not seen my new craft as
yet, but intend it shall take us to Honolulu and
perhaps to Japan."</p>

<p>"How delightful," cried Orissa, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Would you like to join our party?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you; I couldn't," quite regretfully;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"I am too busy just now advancing the fortunes
of my brother Stephen, who is really the most
clever inventor of a&euml;roplanes in the world. Don't
smile, please; he is, indeed! The world may not
admit it as yet, but it soon will. Have you heard
of his latest contrivance? It is a Hydro-Aircraft,
and its engines propel it equally as well on water
as on land."</p>

<p>"Then it beats my yacht," said Madeline,
smiling.</p>

<p>"It is more adaptable&mdash;more versatile&mdash;to be
sure," said Orissa. "Stephen has just completed
his first Hydro-Aircraft, and while I am in San
Diego I shall test it and make a long trip over the
Pacific Ocean to exploit its powers. Such a
machine would not take the place of a yacht, you
know, and the motor boat attachment is merely
a safety device to allow one to fly over water as
well as over land. Then, if you are obliged to
descend, your aircraft becomes a motor boat
and the engines propel it to the shore."</p>

<p>"Does your brother use the Gnome engines?"
inquired Mr. Tupper.</p>

<p>"No; Stephen makes his own engines, which I
think are better than any others," answered Miss
Kane.</p>

<p>By the time the train drew into the station at
San Diego, Madeline Dentry and her companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the Tuppers, knew considerably more of a&euml;roplanes
than the average layman, for Orissa Kane
enjoyed explaining the various machines and,
young and unassuming as she appeared, understood
every minute detail of their manufacture.
She had been her brother's assistant and companion
from the time of his first experiments and
intelligently followed the creation and development
of the now famous Kane Aircraft.</p>

<p>At the depot a large crowd was in waiting, not
gathered to meet the great heiress, Madeline
Dentry, but the quiet slip of a girl whose name
was on every tongue and whose marvelous skill
as a bird-maid had aroused the admiration of
every person interested in a&euml;rial sports. On the
billboards were glaring posters of "The Flying
Girl," the chief attraction of the coming aviation
meet, and the news of her expected arrival had
drawn many curious inhabitants of the Sunshine
City to the depot, as well as the friends
congregated to greet her.</p>

<p>First of all a tall, fine looking fellow, who limped
slightly, sprang forward to meet Orissa at the
car steps and gave her a kiss and a hug. This was
Stephen Kane, the airship inventor, and close
behind him stood a grizzled gentleman in a long
gray coat and jaunty Scotch cap. It was Mr.
Cumberford, the "angel" and manager of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
youthful Kanes, the man whose vast wealth had
financed the Kane Aircraft and enabled the boy
and girl to carry out their ambitious plans. This
strange man had neither ambition to acquire more
money nor to secure fame by undertaking to pilot
the Aircraft to success; as he stood here, his bored
expression, in sharp contrast to the shrewd gray
eyes that twinkled behind his spectacles, clearly
indicated this fact; but a little kindness had won
him to befriend the young people and he had
rendered them staunch support.</p>

<p>On Mr. Cumberford's arm was a slender girl
dressed all in black, the nodding sable plumes of
whose broad hat nearly hid Orissa from view as
the two girls exchanged a kiss. Sybil Cumberford
had no claim to beauty except for her dark
eyes&mdash;so fathomless and mysterious that they
awed all but her most intimate friends, and
puzzled even them.</p>

<p>And now an awkward young fellow&mdash;six feet
three and built like an athlete&mdash;slouched bashfully
forward and gripped Orissa Kane's outstretched
hand. Here was the press agent of the Kane-Cumberford
alliance, Mr. H. Chesterton Radley-Todd;
a most astonishing youth who impressed
strangers as being a dummy and his friends as the
possessor of a rarely keen intellect. Orissa smiled
at him; there was something humorous about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Radley-Todd's loose-jointed, unwieldy personality.
Then she took her brother's arm and
passed through the eager, admiring throng to the
automobile in waiting.</p>

<p>Beside Mr. Cumberford's car stood a handsome
equipage that had been sent for Miss Dentry's
party, and as Orissa nodded to her recent
acquaintances Sybil Cumberford inquired:</p>

<p>"Who is that girl?"</p>

<p>"A Miss Dentry, of New York, with whom I
exchanged some remarks on the train. She has
a yacht in the bay here."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I've heard all about her," returned
Sybil, indifferently. "She's dreadfully rich; rather
snubbed New York society, which was eager to
idolize her&mdash;says she's too young for the weary,
heart-breaking grind&mdash;and indulges in such
remarkable fancies that she's getting herself
talked about. I hope you didn't encourage her
advances, Orissa?"</p>

<p>"I fear I did," was the laughing reply; "but
she seemed very nice and agreeable&mdash;for a rich
girl. Tell me, Steve," she added, turning to her
brother, "what news of the Hydro-Aircraft?"</p>

<p>"It's great, Orissa! I put the finishing touches
on it night before last, and yesterday Mr. Cumberford
and I took a trial spin in it. It carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
two beautifully," he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Did you go over the water?" asked Orissa.</p>

<p>"Nearly half a mile. Then we dropped and let
the engine paddle us home. Of all the hydro-a&euml;roplanes
yet invented, Ris, mine will do the most
stunts and do them with greater ease."</p>

<p>They were rolling swiftly toward the ferry now,
bound for the Hotel del Coronado, a rambling pile
of Spanish architecture that dominates the farther
side of San Diego Bay. Presently the car
took its place in the line of vehicles on the ferry
and Mr. Cumberford, who was driving, shut off
the power and turned to Orissa.</p>

<p>"You are advertised to exhibit the new Hydro-Aircraft
the first day of the meet&mdash;that's Monday,"
he announced. "Do you think you can master
the mechanism by that time?"</p>

<p>"Is it the same old engine, Steve?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Exactly the same, except that I've altered the
controlling levers, to make them handy both
in the air and on water, and balanced the
weight a little differently, to allow for the boat
attachment."</p>

<p>"How did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Placed the gasoline tanks in the rear. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
makes the engine feed from the back, instead of
from directly overhead, you see."</p>

<p>Orissa nodded.</p>

<p>"I think I can manage it, Mr. Cumberford," she
decided. "Will Steve go with me on Monday?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no," returned the manager, a trifle
embarrassed. "Our fool press agent had an idea
the event would be more interesting if two girls
made the flight out to sea, and the trip back by
boat. Sybil has been crazy to go, and so I let
Chesty Todd have his own way."</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Kane," added Mr. H. Chesterton
Radley-Todd, who was seated beside Mr. Cumberford,
while Stephen and the two girls rode
behind, "the management of the meet couldn't
get another aviatress to take part, because you
had been engaged to fly. The other air-maids are
all jealous of your reputation and popularity, I
guess, so the management was in despair. The
dear public is daffy, just now, to watch a female
risk her precious life; it's more thrilling than
when a male ventures it. So, as they're paying
us pretty big money, and Miss Cumberford was
anxious to go, I&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is quite satisfactory to me," announced
Orissa quietly. "I shall enjoy having Sybil with
me."</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't object," said Sybil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"The only thing I don't like about it," observed
Stephen, reflectively, "is the fact that you have
never yet seen my Hydro-Aircraft. It's safe
enough, either on land or water; but if the thing
balks&mdash;as new inventions sometimes do&mdash;there
will be no one aboard to help you remedy the
fault, and the invention is likely to get a black
eye."</p>

<p>"Give me a tool bag and I'll do as well as
any mechanician," responded Orissa, confidently.
"And your Hy is not going to balk, Steve, for
I shall know as much about it as you do by
Monday."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<small>THE GIRL WITH THE A&Euml;ROPLANE</small></h2>


<p>The morning following Orissa Kane's arrival,
which was the Saturday preceding the meet, she
went with her brother Stephen to his hangar,
which was located near the Glenn Curtiss aviation
camp on a low bluff overlooking the Pacific. There
the two spent the entire forenoon in a careful
inspection of the new Hydro-Aircraft.</p>

<p>As she had told Madeline Dentry, the Flying
Girl never wittingly took chances in the dangerous
profession she followed. The remarkable success
of her a&euml;rial performances was due to an exact
knowledge of every part of her a&euml;roplane. She
knew what each bolt and brace was for and how
much strain it would stand; she knew to a
feather's weight the opposition of the planes to
the air, the number of revolutions to drive the
engine under all conditions and the freaks of the
unreliable atmospheric currents. And aside from
this knowledge she had that prime quality known
as "the aviator's instinct"&mdash;the intuition what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
do in emergencies, and the coolness to do it
promptly.</p>

<p>Stephen Kane, who adored his pretty little sister,
had not the slightest fear for her. As she had
stood at his side during the construction of
his first successful a&euml;roplane and learned such
mechanical principles of flying as he himself
knew, he had no doubt she could readily comprehend
the adaptation he had made to convert his
Aircraft into the amphibious thing that could
navigate air and water alike.</p>

<p>"It seems to me quite perfect, Steve," was
Orissa's final verdict. "There is no question but
the Hydro-Aircraft will prove more useful to the
world than any simple a&euml;roplane. If we could
carry gasoline enough, I would venture across the
Pacific in this contrivance. By the way, what
am I to do on Monday? Must I carry Sybil in
any certain direction, or for any given distance?"</p>

<p>"I'll let Chesty explain that," said Steve, turning
to the youthful press agent, who had just
then entered the hangar in company with Mr.
Cumberford and Sybil.</p>

<p>"Why, er&mdash;er&mdash;a certain program has been
announced, you know," explained Chesty Todd;
"but that doesn't count, of course. We'll say that
owing to high winds, contrary air currents, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
some other excuse, you had to alter your plans.
That'll satisfy the dear public, all right."</p>

<p>Orissa frowned slightly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't compromise me in such ways,
Mr. Todd," she exclaimed. "The Kane-Cumberford
Camp has the reputation of fulfilling its
engagements to the letter; but if you promise
impossible things of course we cannot do them."</p>

<p>The young man flushed. In the presence of
Orissa Kane this big fellow was as diffident as a
schoolboy.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't think I promised too much," he
stammered. "There are two or three islands off
this coast, known as the Coronado Islands. The
big one&mdash;you can see it plainly from here&mdash;is
named Sealskin. No one knows why. There are
seals there, and they have skins. Perhaps that's
the reason. Or they may all be related, and the
seals' kin play together on the rocks."</p>

<p>"Be sensible, Chesty!" This from Mr. Cumberford,
rather impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'm quite sensible of Miss Kane's annoyance,"
resumed Mr. Radley-Todd, "but I hope she will
find her task easy. She has merely to fly to Sealskin
Island, a dozen or fifteen miles&mdash;perhaps
twenty&mdash;and alight on the bosom of the blue
Pacific. Mighty poetical in the advertisements,
eh? Then she'll ride back in motor boat fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
When she approaches the shore she is to mount
into the air again, circle around the hotel and land
on the aviation field before the grand stand. If
any part of this program seems difficult, we can
cut it out and tell the reporters&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steve," interrupted Orissa, "can I rise from
the water into the air?"</p>

<p>"Of course. That's my pet invention. While
skimming along the water you lift this lever, free
the propeller, then point your elevator and&mdash;up
you go!"</p>

<p>"Run out the machine. We will make a trial
and you shall show me how it is done. The rest
of Chesty's program seems easy enough, and if
I master this little trick of rising from the water
we will carry out our contract to the letter."</p>

<p>"All right. Your costume is in that little dressing
room in the corner, Ris."</p>

<p>While his sister donned her short skirt, leggings
and helmet, Stephen Kane called his mechanicians
and had the Hydro-Aircraft rolled out
of the hangar and headed toward the ocean. For
himself, he merely put on a sweater and his cap
and visor, being ready long before Orissa
appeared.</p>

<p>The inventor seldom flew his own craft, for an
accidental fall had lamed him so that he was not
as expert an aviator as his sister had proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
be. He was recovering from his hurt, however,
and hoped the injured leg would soon be good as
new. Meantime Orissa was doing more to render
the Kane Aircraft famous than any man might
have done.</p>

<p>A wire fence encircled the Kane-Cumberford
Camp for some distance, except on the ocean side,
where the bluff protected it from invasion. There
was an entrance gate adjoining the beach road,
and while the assembled party awaited Orissa's
appearance Steve noticed that a motor car stopped
at the gateway and a man and woman alighted
and entered the enclosure, leisurely approaching
the spot where the Hydro-Aircraft stood.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Sybil, whose dark eyes were
far-seeing; "it's that girl who owns the yacht,
Madeline what's-her-name."</p>

<p>"Dentry," said Steve. "I wonder if Orissa
invited her here. Go and meet them, Chesty, and
find out."</p>

<p>Mr. Radley-Todd promptly unlimbered his long
legs and advanced to meet Madeline and Mr.
Tupper. The press agent had an unlimited command
of language when driving his pen over
paper, but was notably awkward in expressing
himself conversationally. He now stopped short
before the visitors, removed his hat and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;pardon me, but&mdash;er&mdash;was your appointment
for this hour?"</p>

<p>"Is Miss Kane here, sir?" asked Madeline,
unabashed.</p>

<p>"She is, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dentry."</p>

<p>"Oh; thank you."</p>

<p>"Then I will see her," and she took a step forward.
But Chesty Todd did not move his huge
bulk out of the way. So many curious and bold
people were prone to intrude on all aviators, and
especially on Miss Kane, that it was really necessary
to deny them in a positive manner in order to
secure any privacy at all. The press agent, in
his halting way, tried to explain.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Kane&mdash;is about to&mdash;er&mdash;test
the powers of our new Hydro-Aircraft, and I
regret to say that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;the test is private,
you know."</p>

<p>"How fortunate that we came just now!" cried
Madeline, eagerly, as she flashed her most winning
smile on the young man. "Please lead us
directly to Miss Kane, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes; of course; please lead us to Miss Kane,"
echoed Mr. Tupper pompously.</p>

<p>Chesty succumbed and led them to the group
surrounding the machine, just as Orissa emerged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>from the hangar. Recognizing her recent traveling
companion, the Flying Girl ran up and greeted
her cordially, introducing her and Mr. Tupper
to the others present.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try out our new Hy," she said,
with a laugh. "'Hy,' you must know, is my
abbreviation of the Hydro-Aircraft&mdash;too long a
word altogether. If you will promise not to criticize
us, in case we foozle, you are welcome to
watch our performance."</p>

<p>"That will be glorious," returned Madeline.
"We have been to the bay to inspect the <i>Salvador</i>,
my new yacht, but being anxious to see your new
Aircraft and hoping to find you here, we ventured
to stop for a few minutes. Forgive us if we
intruded."</p>

<p>She spoke so frankly and was so evidently
unconscious of being unwelcome that the entire
group accepted her presence and that of her
uncle without murmur.</p>

<p>Steve took his place in the "Hy" and Orissa
sat beside him.</p>

<p>The motor boat attachment, which took the place
of the ordinary running gear, was of sheet aluminum,
as light and yet as strongly built as was possible
for a thing intended to be practical. Adjustable
wheels, which could be folded back when the
boat was in the water, were placed on either side,
to give the craft a land start. The huge engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was beautiful in appearance, while the planes&mdash;a
crossed arrangement peculiar to the Kane Aircraft&mdash;were
immaculately white in their graceful
spread.</p>

<p>"This upper plane," said Steve, proud to
explain the marvels of his latest mechanical pet,
"is so arranged that its position may be altered
by means of a lever. If you're on the water and
want to save gasoline you adjust the plane as a
sail and let the wind drive you."</p>

<p>"Clever! Very clever, indeed," observed Mr.
Tupper. "I had no idea these flying machines
had been improved so much since I last saw an
aviation meet, some six months ago."</p>

<p>"The art of flying is still in its infancy, sir,"
replied Mr. Cumberford. "It is progressing with
wonderful strides, however, and young Kane is
one of those remarkable geniuses who keep a pace
ahead of the procession."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Steve started the engine, and
as the first low rumble of the propeller increased
to a roar the machine darted forward, passed the
edge of the bluff and, rising slightly, sped over the
placid waters of the Pacific, straight out from
shore.</p>

<p>He did not rise very high, but half a mile or so
out the aviator described a half-circle and then, as
gracefully as a swan, sank to the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
ocean. Instantly a white wake of foam appeared
at the rear of the boat, showing that the propeller
was now churning the water. And now, with
speed that to the observers appeared almost
incredible, the Hydro-Aircraft approached the
shore. A few yards from the bluff it abruptly
rose from the water, sailed above the heads of the
spectators, and after a circle of the field, came to
a halt at almost the exact spot from which it had
started.</p>

<p>This remarkable performance had taken place
in so brief a space of time that those on the bluff
had scarcely moved during the entire period.
They now hastened forward to congratulate the
inventor. Mr. Cumberford's grim features were
for once wreathed in smiles; Chesty Todd capered
like a schoolboy and flung his hat into the air as
he yelled "Hooray!" while Sybil impulsively
grasped Steve's hand in both of her own. As for
Madeline Dentry, she eyed the young man wonderingly,
asking herself if the marvel she seemed
to have witnessed had actually occurred.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Mr. Tupper, his voice
trembling with excitement, "I wouldn't much
mind a ride like that myself!"</p>

<p>Orissa was much pleased with this successful
test of the new machine's powers. As the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
wheeled the Hydro-Aircraft back to its hangar
she turned to Chesty and said:</p>

<p>"I forgive you, sir. Really, you were too modest
in your promises. Sybil and I will carry out
your program to the entire satisfaction of the
management and the public, I am positive."</p>

<p>"I can hardly wait for Monday, Ris," exclaimed
Sybil. "If father wasn't so afraid, I
would learn to navigate the Hy myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, you interest me, my dear," returned her
father, blandly; "you do, really. But as your
talents will never enable you to rival Orissa it
will be well for you to curb your ambitions. I've
conceded a lot, to allow you to go with her on that
long jaunt Monday."</p>

<p>"You have, indeed," laughed Orissa. "But
Sybil and I will have a real joy ride, and be perfectly
safe in the bargain. How long a time will
the trip take us, Steve?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a couple of hours, or so; it will depend on
whether the current is favorable to your paddling
back. In the air you can do forty miles an hour,
easily."</p>

<p>"We will take some lunch with us," said Sybil.
"Don't forget to order it, Daddy."</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford nodded. Unimpressionable as
this strange man seemed, his daughter was verily
the "apple of his eye" and he was not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
forget anything that might add to her comfort.
Sybil's desire to aviate had been a constant
source of disturbance to her father. He had
worried a good deal over Orissa, during her first
attempts to fly, but was now convinced of the
girl's capability and, although he exhibited nervousness
every time she gave one of her exhibitions,
he had by degrees acquired supreme
confidence in her skill. Still, being thoroughly
experienced in all aviation matters, through his
connection with the Kane Aircraft, Mr. Cumberford
realized that flying is always accompanied
by danger, and whenever an aviator met with an
accident on the field he was wont to inform Sybil
that on no account could she ever accompany
Orissa again in a flight. He would even urge
Orissa to abandon the dangerous work; but she
answered him gravely: "This accident, as well
as all others I ever heard of, was the result of
carelessness and inexperience. The more flights
I make the less liable am I to encounter accident.
Perhaps I realize better than you do, Mr. Cumberford,
the elements of danger, and that is the
reason I am so careful to avoid every hazard."</p>

<p>Flying was an intoxication to Sybil. She never
had enough of it and always complained to Orissa
that their flights were of too short duration.
Each time she was obliged to plead and argue with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
her father for days, before obtaining his consent
to let her go, and even now, when he had given his
reluctant permission to Chesty Todd to advertise
Sybil as the companion of the Flying Girl,
he was frequently impelled to forbid the adventure.
His only consolation was that the new
invention seemed very safe and practical, and
with Orissa's guiding hands at the levers his
beloved daughter would be as well guarded as
possible under such conditions.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, protests from Mr. Cumberford
had little value, as Sybil possessed a
knack of getting her own way under any and all
circumstances. She had really no great desire to
operate an a&euml;roplane herself, being quite content
to remain a passenger and enjoy the freedom of
riding, untrammeled by the necessity of being
alert every instant to control the machine.</p>

<p>Orissa, excusing herself, retired to the hangar
to change her costume, and the young inventor
was left to listen to the enthusiastic comments of
his friends.</p>

<p>"When will your Hydro-Aircraft be on the market,
Mr. Kane?" asked Madeline.</p>

<p>"In the course of the next three months we
expect to complete two other machines," he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want one of them," she said quickly. "Will
you teach me how to operate it?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered. "That is part of
the bargain. But you have not asked the price,
and for all business transactions I must refer you
to Mr. Cumberford."</p>

<p>"Madeline, my dear! My dear Madeline!" protested
Mr. Tupper; "what in the world are you
thinking of?"</p>

<p>"That I would give Mr. Cumberford a check at
once," she calmly answered.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;we&mdash;that is, I can't permit it; I&mdash;I
really can't allow it, my dear!" asserted the gentleman,
evidently alarmed by her positive attitude.</p>

<p>Madeline's slight form stiffened and her eyes
flashed defiantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tupper," said she to her uncle, "do I
employ you to advise me, or to manage my business
affairs?"</p>

<p>That he was greatly humiliated by this attack
was evident. His face grew red and he half turned
away, hesitating to make reply. Then Mr. Cumberford
came to Mr. Tupper's assistance.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;eh&mdash;friend&mdash;is quite right, Miss Dentry;
quite right to oppose your&mdash;eh&mdash;reckless impulse,
if I may put it that way. Your enthusiasm
interests me; it&mdash;eh&mdash;interests me greatly; but
for your own welfare and the comfort of mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
your friends, I should advise you to&mdash;eh&mdash;curb
your adventurous spirit, for the present. You
have what is known as the 'Flying Fever,' which
attacks the most conservative people when on the
aviation field. Let it alone and it will dissipate,
in time; but if you nurse it you&mdash;eh&mdash;buy a flying
machine and become a slave. We have machines
to sell, you know; we are anxious to dispose of all
we can; but kindly keep your check for three
months, and if at the end of that time you are
still disposed to purchase, I will deliver the machine
to you promptly."</p>

<p>"How can you do that? The demand will be
greater than your ability to build the Hydro-Aircraft,
after the exhibition of next Monday,"
she affirmed.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford regarded her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," said he. "Anyhow,
I hope you are right. But I'll promise to reserve
a machine, pending your decision. Young ladies
who are seriously determined to become aviators
and who&mdash;eh&mdash;have the means to indulge the fad
to any extent, are rare; very rare. Therefore, my
dear Miss Dentry, you&mdash;eh&mdash;interest me, and I'll
keep my promise."</p>

<p>Madeline could not refuse to admit the fairness
of Mr. Cumberford's proposition, and Mr. Tupper
was grateful to him for his efficient support, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
harmony was once more restored. Sybil, indeed,
smiled derisively as she exchanged a meaning
glance with Madeline&mdash;a glance that said as intelligently
as words: "How clever these men think
themselves, and how helpless they really are to
oppose us!"</p>

<p>Then Miss Dentry invited them all, including
Chesty Todd, to dine on board her yacht the next
day, which was Sunday, and the invitation being
promptly accepted they all motored back to the
hotel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>A PRODIGY IN AERONAUTICS</small></h2>


<p>San Diego Bay is always interesting, with its
shipping from all ports of the world, but on this
gorgeous Sunday afternoon there was no prettier
sight among the scattered craft than the trim
yacht <i>Salvador</i>, lying at anchor just north of the
ferry path. The Kane-Cumberford party found a
small launch awaiting them at the pier, which
quickly took them aboard the big white yacht,
where Madeline, attired in appropriate sailor costume,
cordially welcomed them.</p>

<p>"This affair is fully as great a novelty to me
as it must be to you," she explained, as they cast
admiring glances over the decks. "I bought the
boat of an Englishman several months ago, with
the understanding it should be delivered to me
here; but I only arrived to claim it the day before
yesterday. It has a crew of seven, besides the
chef, who, I must admit, is my own selection, as
I feared to trust the English taste in cookery.
The English crew, however, seems capable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
every man jack wants to stay with the boat; so
I've agreed to keep them. I'll introduce you to
the skipper presently. He rejoices in the title of
'Captain' and has quite awed me with his
superior manner and splendid uniform. But I'll
introduce you to the creations of my chef, first,
for dinner is waiting. Forgive Monsieur Champetre,
if he falls down occasionally; he is as unused
to the kitchen&mdash;or is it scullery? Oh, I know; the
'galley'&mdash;as I am to the cabin."</p>

<p>Really the chef needed no excuses, and after the
meal they made a thorough inspection of the beautiful
craft, peeping into the state-rooms, the men's
quarters and even into the sacred galley. Everyone
aboard, including the big, bluff skipper, was
so proud of the boat that he delighted to have it
exhibited, and when it was understood that the
slim, beautiful young lady guest was the famous
Flying Girl the deference shown Orissa was
amusing.</p>

<p>"I had intended to test the <i>Salvador</i> to-morrow
and make a short run to sea in it," said Madeline;
"but I am so eager to witness the a&euml;rial exhibitions
that I shall postpone the voyage until later.
My yacht is permanent, but this Aviation Meet is
temporary."</p>

<p>The visitors returned to their hotel early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
afternoon, for Orissa and Sybil had still a few
preparations to make for the morrow's trip, while
Steve and Mr. Cumberford decided to pay a visit
to the aviation field, to which both the Kane Aircraft
and the Kane Hydro-Aircraft had been
removed by the mechanicians in charge of them.
Chesty Todd's labors that Sunday evening were
perhaps more onerous than those of the others of
his party, for he had to meet an aggressive band
of newspaper reporters and load each one to the
brim with material for a double-header next
morning. Having served as a journalist&mdash;and an
able one&mdash;himself, Mr. Radley-Todd understood
exactly the sort of priming these publicity guns
required.</p>

<p>The home of the Kanes was a delightful orange
ranch near Los Angeles, where the blind mother
of Stephen and Orissa&mdash;their only parent&mdash;lived
surrounded by every comfort and devoted attendants,
while her boy and girl were engaged in the
novel and somewhat hazardous exhibitions of the
new Kane Aircraft. Orissa had remained at
home with her mother while Stephen was perfecting
his latest machine at San Diego, and had not
left there until it was necessary to prepare for
the Meet, in which she had engaged to take part.
Mrs. Kane, perhaps because of her blindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
seemed to have little anxiety on account of her
daughter's ventures, although at the time of
Orissa's first flights her nervousness had been
poignant. Assured of her girl's skill and coolness,
the mother had come to accept these occasions
philosophically, as far as the danger was concerned,
and she was naturally interested in Steve's
inventions and overjoyed at the financial success
which Mr. Cumberford's business ability had
already insured the firm.</p>

<p>This Sunday evening Orissa wrote a long letter
to her mother, telling how perfectly her brother's
new machine worked, and assuring Mrs. Kane of
her confidence in winning new laurels for Stephen
on the morrow. "The latest engine, made for the
Hy, is more powerful than were the others," she
added, "but its operation is practically the same
and while the combination of boat and aircraft
necessitated a more complicated arrangement of
the control, I have easily mastered all the details
and could take the whole thing apart and put it
together again, if obliged to do so."</p>

<p>The girl slept peacefully that night and neither
she nor Sybil were in the least nervous when they
went to the aviation field, overlooking the sea,
after an early luncheon on Monday.</p>

<p>They found the Kane Hydro-Aircraft reposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
majestically in its hangar, in perfect order and
constantly surrounded by a group of admiring
and interested spectators. The little band of professional
aviators present at the Meet welcomed
Orissa very cordially, for every one of them knew
and admired the brave girl who had so often
proved her ability to manage her brother's
machines.</p>

<p>The grand stand was packed with spectators,
and long rows of automobiles lined the edge of
the enclosure reserved for the exhibitors.</p>

<p>The "Kane Event," as it was called, was early
on the program of the day, for it was understood
that the flight over the ocean and the voyage back
would consume much of the afternoon. Many had
brought binoculars and other powerful glasses to
watch the Flying Girl and her chum during their
progress.</p>

<p>Sealskin Island lay a little to the south of the
aviation field and was one of a group of barren
rocks jutting out of the sea and plainly visible
from the mainland. The Coronado Islands, which
have little or no value, belong to Mexico, as the
Mexican boundary is only twelve miles south of
San Diego, and this group, although not appearing
to be so far south, is below the line claimed by
the United States. Therefore Orissa's flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
would be in a southwesterly direction and most of
her journey made in plain view of every spectator.</p>

<p>As the "Hy" was run out to the center of the
field Steve said to Orissa:</p>

<p>"I've anchored an aluminum chest just back of
your seats, at the suggestion of Mr. Cumberford.
In it are all the tools you could possibly need in
case of emergency, a couple of warm blankets to
use if your return trip proves chilly, and enough
'lunch'&mdash;which I think Sybil pleaded for&mdash;to last
you both a week. The chest enables you to carry
all this safely and comfortably, and it won't be at
all in your way. Personally, I think such a precaution
wholly unnecessary, but Mr. Cumberford
is a good deal of an old woman where Sybil is
concerned and it is easier to give up to him than
to try to argue him out of an idea. Take the trip
easy, Ris; we don't need to make time. What we
want to demonstrate is the practicability of the
machine, and we ourselves already know that it
is thoroughly practical, and we therefore ought to
be able to convince the world of the fact."</p>

<p>Orissa nodded.</p>

<p>"How about gasoline?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Both tanks are filled. There's enough to run
you a hundred miles in air and fifty miles in
water, which is far more than you will require.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Be gentle with the steering gear; it is such a long
connection that it doesn't respond as readily as
the old one, and I guess I've made the rods a trifle
too light. I mean to rig up a more substantial
device as soon as I get time, but this will do you
all right if you don't jerk it. Put a little more
strength to the wheel and turn it gradually,
that's all."</p>

<p>"I understand," she replied. "Are you ready,
Sybil?"</p>

<p>"Waiting on you, Ris."</p>

<p>"And I think the crowd is waiting on us."</p>

<p>The band was at this moment playing its loudest
and most stirring tune and as the two venturesome
girls, dressed in appropriate a&euml;rial
costume, appeared on the field, wildly enthusiastic
shouts rose from ten thousand spectators.
Chesty Todd had decorated the braces of the
machine with bunches of fresh violets and the
aluminum and nickeled parts shone gloriously in
the sun.</p>

<p>"Be good, Sybil," said Mr. Cumberford. "Take
care of her, Orissa."</p>

<p>The girls laughed, for this was the old gentleman's
customary parting warning.</p>

<p>"All right, Ris," said Steve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>She applied the power and one of the mechanicians
gave the propeller a preliminary whirl.
Then Orissa threw in the automatic clutch that
started the machine and it ran forward a few
feet and promptly rose into the air. A moment
later it was speeding straight out to sea, at an
altitude of a hundred feet, and the wonderful voyage
of Stephen Kane's new Hydro-Aircraft was
begun&mdash;a voyage destined to vary considerably
from the program mapped out for it.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<small>THE ALUMINUM CHEST</small></h2>


<p>Orissa realized quite perfectly that Sealskin
Island was much farther away from the mainland
than it appeared, so on leaving the shore she pursued
a direction straight west for several miles,
intending to make a turn and proceed south to
the island which was the terminus of her flight.
That prolonged the trip somewhat, but she figured
it would prove more interesting to the spectators,
since for a part of the journey she would
be flying parallel with the coast. On the return
she planned to run straight back from the island.</p>

<p>When she decided they had reached a point
about as far out as was the island, she attempted
to make the turn&mdash;a mere segment of a circle&mdash;but
in spite of Steve's warning Orissa was surprised
at the stiffness of the steering gear. The
engines were working beautifully and developing
excellent speed, but the girl found she must apply
all her strength to the wheel to make the turn.</p>

<p>She succeeded, and brought the head to bear
directly upon the island, but the gear grated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
stuck so persistently that Orissa's effort sent the
entire craft careening at a steep angle. Sybil
gave a gasp and clung to the supporting rods and
both girls heard a loud "chug" that indicated
something was wrong; but the Kane balancing
device was so perfect that almost immediately the
machine righted itself and regained its equilibrium,
darting swiftly and in a straight line in the
direction of the island.</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Sybil, putting her head
close to Orissa's to be heard above the whir of
the motors behind them.</p>

<p>"The steering gear binds; that's all," was the
quiet response. "I think it will work better when
we are in the water."</p>

<p>"But what made that noise? Didn't something
give way?" persisted Sybil.</p>

<p>"Glance behind us, dear, and see."</p>

<p>Sybil carefully turned so as to examine the
parts of the a&euml;roplane.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Orissa.</p>

<p>"That chest that Steve loaded us with. It has
broken away from its fastenings and is jammed
edge downward against your gear."</p>

<p>Orissa thought about it.</p>

<p>"That's unfortunate," said she. "I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the bolts broke when we tipped so badly. But it
hasn't interfered with our engines any."</p>

<p>"No," answered Sybil, still examining the conditions;
"but it has interfered seriously with your
control, I fear. Both your levers are thrown out
of position and even the front elevator bars are
badly bent."</p>

<p>For the first time a worried expression appeared
on Orissa's face.</p>

<p>"If that is true," she said, "our best plan is to
return at once."</p>

<p>"Do," urged Sybil, her dark eyes very serious.</p>

<p>Orissa tried to turn the wheel. It resisted.
She applied more strength. Something snapped
and the released wheel whirled so freely that the
girl nearly lost her seat. Recovering instantly
she turned a pale face to her companion and said:</p>

<p>"We're wrecked, Sybil. But don't worry.
With the boat under us and in this quiet sea we
shall be quite safe."</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying&mdash;especially&mdash;Ris," was the
reply; "but it occurs to me to wonder how you're
going to get down to the ocean."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You can't stop the engines, unless one of us
crawls back over the planes."</p>

<p>"I can cut off the spark." She tried it, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
engines chugged as merrily as before. "Guess
there must be a short circuit," gasped Orissa.</p>

<p>"And you can't depress your elevator, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"I'll try it," announced Orissa, grimly.</p>

<p>But the fatal chest balked her attempt. The
elevator was steadfastly wedged into its present
position; the engines were entirely beyond control
and the two helpless girls faced one of the
most curious conditions ever known in the history
of aviation.</p>

<p>At an altitude of perhaps a hundred and fifty
feet from the water the a&euml;roplane sped swiftly on
its way, headed a trifle to the west of south. It
passed Sealskin Island even while the girls were
discussing their dilemma, and stubbornly maintained
its unfaltering course. The air conditions
were perfect for flying; scarcely a breath of wind
was felt; the sky above was blue as azure.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sybil laughed.</p>

<p>"What now?" demanded Orissa.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the consternation on shore
at about this moment," explained Miss Cumberford.
"Won't they be amazed to see us continue
this course, beyond the island? Not understanding
our trouble, Daddy will think we're running
away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"So we are," replied Orissa. "I wish I knew
where we are running to."</p>

<p>"I suppose we can't stop till the gasoline gives
out," said Sybil.</p>

<p>Orissa shook her head.</p>

<p>"That's what scares me," she admitted. "Even
now the Mexican shore is a mere line at the left.
We're gradually diverging to a point farther out
at sea, and when at last we alight, drained of the
last drop of gasoline, how are we to run the boat
back?"</p>

<p>"We can't. Steve's wonderful Hy will become
a mere floating buoy on the bosom of the rolling
blue," responded Sybil lightly. "Oh, I'm so glad
I came, Ris! I'd no idea we were going to have
such fun."</p>

<p>Orissa did not return her chum's smile.</p>

<p>"Sit still and balance her, Sybil," she said.
"I'm going to make an investigation."</p>

<p>Exercising the necessary caution she turned
and knelt upon the foot bar, clinging to the seat
rail and in this position facing the Aircraft so she
could examine its mechanism. Sybil had described
the condition of things quite accurately. The
engine control was cut off and as the gasoline
tanks fed from the rear Orissa had no way of
stopping the flow. The steering gear was broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and the front elevator firmly wedged in position
by the chest.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we could manage to move this
thing," she said, and getting a hand on one corner
of the aluminum chest she gave a tug and tried
to raise it. It proved solid and unyielding. Not
heavy in itself, or perhaps in its contents, the
thing was caught between the rods in such a manner
that no strength of the girls, limited in movement
as they were, could budge it a particle.</p>

<p>Realizing this, and the folly of leaving the seats
to get at the gasoline feed, Orissa resumed her
place and faced the inevitable as bravely as she
could.</p>

<p>"Steve told me," she said to Sybil, "that the
gasoline would last a hundred miles in air and
fifty in water; that's at least two hundred miles
in an air line. Have you any idea where we shall
be by that time?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," responded her companion,
cheerfully. "Ocean, of course; but latitude and
longitude a mystery&mdash;and not important, anyhow."</p>

<p>Sybil Cumberford was a reserved and silent girl
on most occasions. Few were attracted toward
her, on this account. Her dark eyes seemed to
regard the world with critical toleration and she
gave one the impression of considering herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
quite independent of her fellows. Moreover, Sybil
was eccentric in character and prone to do and
say things that invoked the grave displeasure of
her associates, seeming to delight in confusing
and annoying them. But there was a brighter
side to this queer girl's nature, which developed
only in the society of her trusted friends. On
any occasion that demanded courage and resourcefulness
she came to the front nobly, and at such
times Sybil Cumberford became vivacious, helpful
and inspiriting.</p>

<p>Here was such an occasion. Danger was the
joy of Sybil's heart and the "breath of her nostrils."
Indifferent to the ordinary details of life,
any adventure that promised tribulation or disaster
was fervently welcomed. Then the girl's
spirits rose, her intellect fairly bristled and she
developed an animation and joyous exhilaration
entirely at variance with her usual demeanor.</p>

<p>So now, as Orissa Kane, a girl of proved courage
and undaunted spirit, grew solemn and
anxious at the perilous condition that confronted
them, Sybil Cumberford became gay and animated.</p>

<p>"It's such an unusual thing, and so wholly
unexpected!" she said blithely. "I'm sure, Ris,
that no two girls who ever lived&mdash;in this world
or any other&mdash;ever found themselves in a like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
dilemma. We're as helpless as babes, chummie
dear; only no babes were ever forced to fly, willy-nilly,
for hundreds of miles through the air to
some forlorn spot in the dank, moist ocean."</p>

<p>Orissa let her chatter. She was trying to realize
what it might mean to them and how and
when, if ever, they might be rescued from their
difficulties.</p>

<p>"Our great mistake," continued Sybil, as they
swept along, "was in not rigging the machine
with a wireless outfit. To be sure, neither of us
could operate it; but a wireless, in such a case&mdash;if
we understood its mysteries&mdash;would solve our
problem."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Orissa.</p>

<p>"We could call up the shore at San Diego and
tell them what's happened, and give them the
direction in which we are flying; then they could
send a fast steamer for us, or perhaps Madeline
Dentry would loan her yacht."</p>

<p>"They may follow us with a steamer, anyhow,"
said Orissa, thoughtfully. "If we manage to land
safely, Sybil&mdash;which means if we drop to the
water right-side-up&mdash;we could float for some days,
until we were found and rescued."</p>

<p>"Thirst is a terrible thing, at sea; and hunger
is almost as bad."</p>

<p>"But in that dreadful chest, which has caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
all our trouble, Steve told me he had packed provisions.
Probably there is water there, too,"
asserted Orissa, hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad said there was lunch for two. Well,
that's one good feed we shall have, anyhow, provided
the chest doesn't get away from us entirely,
and we can manage to open it. In its present
position, neither event is at all probable."</p>

<p>She seemed to love to discover and point out the
gloomy side of their adventure, that she might
exult in the dangers that menaced them.</p>

<p>Meantime, swift and straight as an arrow the
Aircraft continued on its course. Not a skip to
the engines, not an indication of any sort that the
flight would be interrupted as long as a drop of
gasoline remained in the tanks. They could only
be patient and await the finale as bravely as
possible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<small>THE LAST DROP OF GASOLINE</small></h2>


<p>Hour after hour they flew, while each hour
seemed, to Orissa, at least, a month in duration.
Sybil chatted and laughed, refusing to take their
misfortune seriously.</p>

<p>"But," said she, "I'm getting famished. An
air-trip always stimulates the appetite and that
lunch of Steve's is so very near to us&mdash;and yet
so far! I How did he expect us to get at the repast,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Why, in water," replied Orissa, "the chest
and its contents would be handy enough. I do
not think it would be safe for us to creep into the
boat underneath us now, for we must maintain
the a&euml;rial balance; but, even if we could get below,
we couldn't open the chest while it is wedged
crosswise among the braces and levers."</p>

<p>"All true, milady," commented Sybil, her
usually pale cheeks now flushed with excitement.
"Our present stunt is to 'sit still and take our
medicine,' as the saying goes."</p>

<p>By this time the Mexican coast had vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
entirely and only the placid blue waters of the
Pacific remained visible, even from the altitude of
the Aircraft. Once or twice they sighted a small
island, bleak and bare, for this part of the ocean
is filled with tiny islets, most of which are unfertile
and uninhabited. Farther along, in the South
Pacific, such islands have verdure and inhabitants.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock a change occurred in the
atmospheric conditions. A brisk wind arose, blowing
steadily for a time from the southwest and
then suddenly developing puffs and eddies that
caused the Aircraft to wobble dangerously. One
powerful gust seized the helpless flying-machine
and whirled it around like a toy balloon, but failed
to destroy its equilibrium because the girls balanced
it with their bodies as well as they might.
When their craft was released, however, it pointed
in a new direction&mdash;this time straight west. An
hour later a similar gust swept its head to the
southward, and in this direction it was still flying
when the red sun dipped into the water and
twilight fell.</p>

<p>"I don't like this, Syb," said Orissa, anxiously.
"If the gasoline holds out much longer it will be
dark, and when we drop our danger will be
doubled."</p>

<p>"What will be the fashion of our dropping,
anyhow?" asked Sybil. "We can't volplane, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
no control of the rudder. Chances are, dear, the
thing will just tip over and spill us in the damp."</p>

<p>"Hold fast, if it does that," cautioned Orissa.
"If we become separated from the boat we will
drown like rats. The engine may swamp the boat,
in any event, but it has air compartments which
will keep it afloat under any favorable conditions,
and we must trust to luck, Sybil&mdash;and to our own
coolness."</p>

<p>"All right, Ris. A watery grave doesn't appeal
to me just now," was the reply. "I'm too hungry
to drown comfortably, and that's a fact. On a
full stomach I imagine one could face perpetual
soaking with more complacency."</p>

<p>"Huh!" cried Orissa. "Listen!"</p>

<p>Sybil was already listening, fully as alert as
her chum. The speed of the engine was diminishing.
Gradually the huge propeller slackened its
rapid revolutions, while its former roar subsided
to a mere moan.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," said Sybil, fervently, "the
gasoline is gone at last!"</p>

<p>"Look out, then," warned Orissa.</p>

<p>With a final, reluctant "chug-chug!" the engine
stopped short. Like a huge gull the frail craft
remained poised in the air a moment and then a
sudden light breeze swept it on. It was falling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>however, impelled by its own weight, and singularly
enough it reversed its position and proceeded
before the wind with the stem foremost.</p>

<p>Splash! It wasn't so bad, after all. Not a volplane,
to be sure, but a gentle drop, the weight of
the heavy engine sustained by the "air-cushions"
formed beneath the planes.</p>

<p>Orissa wiped the spray from her eyes.</p>

<p>"That would have been a regular bump, on
land," Sybil was saying affably, "but the old
ocean has received us with gracious tenderness.
Are we sinking, Ris, or do we float?"</p>

<p>How suddenly the darkness was falling! Orissa
leaned from her seat and found the water had
turned to a color nearly as black as ink. Beneath
her the bow of the aluminum motor boat was so
depressed that it was almost even with the water
and as it bobbed up and down with the waves it
was shipping the inky fluid by the dipperful.</p>

<p>She scrambled out of the seat, then, to step
gingerly over the unlucky chest and crouch upon
a narrow seat of the little boat, near the stern.</p>

<p>"Come, Sybil," she called; "and be very careful."</p>

<p>Sybil promptly descended to the boat, which
now rode evenly upon the waves. In this position
the propeller was just under water and the engine
rested over the center of the light but strong little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>craft. But propeller and engine were alike useless
to them now. Overhead the planes spread like
huge awnings, but they carried so little weight
that they did not affect the balance of the boat.</p>

<p>"Steve planned well," murmured Orissa, with
a sigh. "If only he had never thought of that
dreadful chest, we would not be in this fix."</p>

<p>As she spoke she kicked the chest a little resentfully
with her foot, and it seemed to move. Sybil
leaned forward to eye it as closely as the gathering
darkness would allow.</p>

<p>"Why, Ris," she exclaimed, "the thing has
come loose. Help me to tip it up."</p>

<p>Between them they easily raised the chest to
its former position, where it rested just before
them. Steve had bolted it at either end, but one
of the bolts had broken away and the other had
bent at almost a right angle. Perhaps this last
bolt would have broken, too, had not the chest, in
falling, become wedged against the braces.</p>

<p>"This horrid box has heretofore been our dire
enemy," remarked Sybil; "but let us be forgiving
and encourage it to make amends&mdash;for it holds
eatables. How does the cover open, Ris?"</p>

<p>Stephen had shown Orissa how to work the
sliding catch and in a moment the girl had the
lid open and held it upright while Sybil searched
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hooray! We've discovered a regular cafeteria,"
said the latter, jubilantly, as she drew out
a number of parcels. "I was afraid we'd have to
nibble, Orissa, so as not to gorge ourselves
to-night and starve to-morrow; but I reckon
there's enough to last two delicate girls like us a
week. What shall we tackle first?"</p>

<p>"Let us plan a little, dear," suggested Orissa,
restraining her own eagerness, for she was hungry,
too. "We cannot possibly tell to-night what
this precious chest contains or how much food
there really is. We must wait for daylight to
take an inventory. But here are some tins, we
know, which will keep, and that package of sandwiches
on your lap is perishable; so I propose we
confine our feast to those for to-night."</p>

<p>"Perishable it is, Cap'n," answered Sybil, consuming
half a sandwich at a single bite. "If there's
only a pickle to go with these breadspreads I shall
be content. It's not only luncheon that we're
indulging in, you know; it's our regular dinner,
as well, and there ought to be two courses&mdash;pickles
and sandwiches&mdash;at the least."</p>

<p>"You must feel for the pickles, then," returned
Orissa, intent upon her own sandwich, "for it's
too dark to use eyes just now."</p>

<p>Sybil found the pickles&mdash;who ever put up a
lunch for two girls without including pickles?&mdash;and
declared she was quite content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we hadn't discovered the eats, my dear
Cap'n," she remarked with cheery satisfaction,
"I think I could have dined on my own shoes.
That's a happy thought; we'll keep the shoes in
reserve. I'd no idea one's appetite could get such
an edge, after being tantalized for a few hours."</p>

<p>"Do you realize, Sybil," asked Orissa in a
grave tone, as she took her second sandwich,
"that we must pass the night in this wiggly,
insecure boat?"</p>

<p>"What's insecure about it?" demanded Sybil.</p>

<p>"It won't stand much of a sea, I fear. This
attachment to the Aircraft was intended for pleasant
weather."</p>

<p>"All right; the weather's delightful. Those
long, gentle rolls will merely rock us to sleep.
And&mdash;Oh, Ris!&mdash;we'll have rolls for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Do be serious, Syb! Suppose a storm catches
us before morning?"</p>

<p>"Then please wake me up. Where do you suppose
we are, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea," answered Orissa, soberly. "We
must have traveled a couple of hundred miles, but
it wasn't in a straight line, by any means. Let's
see. Perhaps a hundred miles on our first course&mdash;over
Sealskin Island and nearly south&mdash;then forty
or fifty miles north&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; west."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; so it was. Then twenty-odd miles south,
ten miles or so east, a couple or three miles west
again, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me! Don't bother your head with it,
Orissa. We zigzagged like a drunken man. The
only fact we can positively nail is that we were
getting farther away from home&mdash;or our friends,
rather&mdash;every minute. That's a bad thing, come
to think of it. They'll never know where to search
for us."</p>

<p>"True," responded Orissa. "But I am sure
they will search, and search diligently, so we must
manage to keep afloat until they find us. What
shall we do now, Sybil?"</p>

<p>"Sleep," was the prompt reply. "If we lift
this seat off&mdash;it seems to be removable&mdash;I think
there is room enough for us both to cuddle down
in the bottom of the boat."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sybil!" This from Orissa, rather reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't imagine anything more sensible
to do," asserted her chum, with a yawn. "These
air-rides not only encourage hunger, but sleep.
Did you cork that bottle of water? I want another
drink."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think we'd better economize on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>water," suggested Orissa, "at least until morning,
when we can find out if there's any more in
the chest."</p>

<p>"All right. Help me bail out this overflow and
then we'll cuddle down."</p>

<p>"Steve said there were two blankets in the
chest," said Orissa, presently, when the bottom
of the boat was dry. "I'll search for them."</p>

<p>She found the blankets easily, by feeling
through the contents of the chest. Offering no
further objection to Sybil's plan, she prepared
their bed for the night. Neither of these girls had
ever "roughed it" to any extent, but in spite of
the peril of their situation and the liability of
unforeseen dangers overtaking them, they were
resourceful enough and courageous enough to face
the conditions with a degree of intrepid interest.
Afloat on an unknown part of the broad Pacific,
with merely a tiny aluminum boat for protection,
with final escape from death uncertain and chances
of rescue remote, these two carefully nurtured
young girls, who had enjoyed loving protection all
their lives, were so little influenced by fear that
they actually exchanged pleasantries as they
spread their blankets and rolled themselves in the
coverings for the night.</p>

<p>"The lack of a pillow bothers me most,"
remarked Sybil. "I think I shall rest my head
on one of those cans of baked beans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I advise you not to; you might eat them in
your sleep," was Orissa's comment.</p>

<p>"May I rest my head upon you, chummie dear?"</p>

<p>"You may not. Try the engine."</p>

<p>"That's hard. And there are enough wheels in
my head already, without pounding my ear with
them. Suggest something else."</p>

<p>"Your own elbow, then."</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear. Where's that slab of aluminum
that used to be a seat?"</p>

<p>It was a happy thought and furnished them
both with a headrest. The seat was not an ideal
pillow, but it answered the purpose because there
was nothing better.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>CASTAWAYS</small></h2>


<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed Orissa, sitting up.</p>

<p>After a moment Sybil said, sleepily:</p>

<p>"Go ahead and declare it, Ris. Only, if we're
drowned, please break the news to me gently!"</p>

<p>"How strange!" muttered Orissa, still staring.</p>

<p>Sybil stirred, threw off the blanket and also
rose to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"If it's a secret," she began, "then&mdash;Oh,
goodness me!"</p>

<p>During the night the boat with its great overhead
planes had gently floated into a little bay,
where the water was peaceful as a millpond. Two
points of black rock projected on either side of
them, outlining the bay. Between these points
appeared an island&mdash;a mass of tumbled rocks
guiltless of greenery. There was a broad strip of
clean, smooth sand on the shore, barely covering
the slaty ledge, but back of that the jumble of rocks
began, forming irregular hillocks, and beyond
these hillocks, which extended for some distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>inland, there seemed to be a great dip in the landscape&mdash;or
rockscape&mdash;far back of which arose a
low mountain formed of the same unlovely
material as all else.</p>

<p>"It's an island!" gasped Sybil, rubbing her eyes
to make sure they were working properly. "Now,
see here, Cap'n Ris, I want it understood right
now which one of us is to be Robinson Crusoe and
which the Man Friday. Seems to me, I being the
passenger and you the charioteer, the prestige is
on my side; so I claim the Crusoe part. I can't
grow whiskers, and I'm not likely to find a parrot
to perch on my shoulder, but I'll promise to enact
the part as well as circumstances will permit."</p>

<p>"I can't see a sign of life," announced Orissa,
regretfully. "There isn't even a bird hovering
over the place."</p>

<p>"Lizards and snakes among the rocks, though,
I'll bet," responded Sybil, with a grimace. "All
these rocky Pacific islands are snaky, they say. I
wonder if I can learn to charm 'em. You don't
object to my being Crusoe, do you?"</p>

<p>Orissa sighed; then she turned to her cheery
comrade with a smile.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said she. "But I'll be Columbus,
the Discoverer, for I've discovered a desert island
while you were peacefully dreaming."</p>

<p>"There's no desert about your island," stated
Sybil. "A desert would be a relief. What you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
discovered, Miss Ris Columbus&mdash;or what's discovered
us, rather&mdash;is a rock heap."</p>

<p>"Desert or not, it's deserted, all right," maintained
Orissa.</p>

<p>"And you may not have discovered it, after
all," said Sybil, musingly examining the place.
"These seas have been pretty well explored, I
guess, and although no nation would particularly
care to pin a flag to this bunch of rocks, the maps
may indicate it clearly."</p>

<p>"Ah, if we only had a map!" cried Orissa
eagerly.</p>

<p>"What good would it do us?" asked Sybil. "It
couldn't help us to find ourselves, for we don't
know what especial dot on the map we've arrived
at. With Muggins' Complete Atlas in hand, and
a geography teacher thrown in, we wouldn't be
able to pick out this island from the ones that
litter these seas."</p>

<p>"That is, unfortunately, quite true," sighed
Orissa; "and anyhow it's not worth an argument
because we have no map. But we must be up
and doing, Sybil. If we are to keep ourselves
alive, we must take advantage of every favorable
circumstance."</p>

<p>"What time is it?" yawned Sybil.</p>

<p>Orissa looked at her watch.</p>

<p>"A little after six."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Call me at eight. I can't get up at six o'clock;
it's too early, entirely."</p>

<p>"But you went to bed at about seven."</p>

<p>"Did I? Well, how about breakfast?"</p>

<p>"We must inspect our stores and take inventory.
Then we must plan to make the provisions
last as long as possible."</p>

<p>"How dreadful! Why, this is a real adventure,
Ris&mdash;threatened famine, and all that. We're regular
castaways, like we read about in the fifteen-cent
story magazines, and I wouldn't be surprised
if we had to endure many inconveniences; would
you?"</p>

<p>"Sybil," said Orissa earnestly, "we are face
to face with privation, danger, and perhaps death.
I'm glad you can be cheerful, but we must understand
our terrible position and endeavor to survive
as long as possible. We know very well that
our friends will have a hard time finding us, for
they cannot guess what part of the ocean we
descended in. It may take days&mdash;perhaps weeks&mdash;for
them to discover us in this dreary place,
and meantime we must guard our safety to the
best of our ability."</p>

<p>"Naturally," agreed Sybil, duly impressed by
this speech. "Your head is clearer and better
than mine, Orissa; so you shall take command, and
I'll gladly follow your instructions. You mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to land, don't you? I'm tired of this cramped
little boat and even a rocky island is better than
no refuge at all."</p>

<p>"Of course we must land," replied Orissa; "and
that, I think, must be our first task. The shore
is only a stone's throw from here, but we're fast
on a sand bar, and how to get off is a problem."</p>

<p>Sybil began to take off her leggings, then her
shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>"We'll wade," she said.</p>

<p>Orissa peered over the side.</p>

<p>"It's very shallow. I think we can wade to
shore, Syb, and pull the Hy in after us. We must
get the whole thing high and dry on the beach, if
possible."</p>

<p>Sybil plumbed the water by tying a can of sardines
to a cord from around one of the parcels.</p>

<p>"I guess we can make it all right, Cap'n," she
said. "It's not very deep."</p>

<p>"It may be a lot deeper closer in. But I guess
we'll have to take a chance on it. And if the worst
comes to the worst we <i>can</i> dry our clothes on the
beach."</p>

<p>The sun was showing brilliantly above the horizon
as the two girls stepped into the water. Both
could swim fairly well, but where the boat was
grounded on the sand bar the water was scarcely
knee-deep. They dragged Steve's invention over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the bar with little difficulty, the wheels materially
assisting their efforts. Beyond the bar the water
deepened in spots, and once, as they drew the
wrecked Hy after them, the waves reached perilously
high. Then they struck the shelving beach
and found hard sand under their feet.</p>

<p>By pushing and hauling energetically they
managed to run the boat, with its attached planes,
to the shore, where the wheels on either side
enabled them to roll it up the slope until, as
Orissa said, it was "high and dry."</p>

<p>"Seems to me," remarked Sybil, panting, "we
ought to have breakfasted first, for all this exercise
has made me ravenous. That'll diminish our
precious store of eatables considerably, I fear."</p>

<p>With the machine safely landed they proceeded
to dress themselves, after which Orissa arranged
upon the sand the entire contents of the aluminum
chest. A kit of tools, adapted for use on the Aircraft,
together with some extra bolts, a strut or
two and a coil of steel wire were first placed
carefully on one side.</p>

<p>"With these," said the girl, "I can easily
repair the damage to our machine."</p>

<p>"But what's the use, without gasoline?" asked
Sybil.</p>

<p>Orissa had no reply to this. She proceeded to
inspect the provisions. Mr. Cumberford had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
way of always providing enough for a regiment
when he intended to feed a few, so in ordering
lunch for two girls on an a&euml;rial voyage his usual
prodigality had been in evidence. Perhaps with
an intuition that a delay or even an accident might
occur to Sybil and Orissa, the old gentleman had
even exceeded his record, in this instance. A big
box of dainty sandwiches had been supplemented
by three cartons of biscuits, a whole Edam cheese,
a bottle of pickles, two huge packages of cakes
and eighteen tins of provisions, provided with
keys for opening them. These consisted of sardines,
potted ham and chicken, baked beans,
chipped beef and the like. In another parcel was
a whole roasted duck, in still another an apple
pie, while two jars of jam completed the list of
edibles. For the voyagers to drink Mr. Cumberford
had added two half-gallon jars of distilled
water, a bottle of grape juice, two of ginger ale
and one of lemonade.</p>

<p>The girls examined this stock with profound
gravity.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Orissa, "there had been more
bread and biscuits, for we are going to need the
substantials rather more than the delicacies."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness we have anything!" exclaimed
Sybil. "I suppose we must breakfast on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the cakes and jam, and save the other truck until
later."</p>

<p>"That's the idea," approved Orissa. "The
cakes won't keep for long; even the sandwiches
will outlast them, I think."</p>

<p>"True, if I eat all the cake I want," added
Sybil. "Cakes and jam make a queer breakfast,
Orissa. In New England the pie would be
appropriate."</p>

<p>"Let's save the pie&mdash;for lunch."</p>

<p>"Agreed. Breakfast isn't usually my strong
point, you know."</p>

<p>As they ate, seated together upon the sands,
they cast many curious glances at the interior of
the island&mdash;a prospect forbidding enough.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Orissa, "the scarcity of
food doesn't worry me so much as the scarcity
of water. Grape juice and ginger ale are well
enough in their way, but they don't take the place
of water."</p>

<p>"We may possibly find water on this island,"
replied Sybil, after a little thought.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. I've an idea that, hunt
as we may, we shall find nothing more than
rocks, and rocks, and rocks&mdash;anywhere and
everywhere."</p>

<p>"That's merely a hunch, and I distrust hunches.
It will be better to explore," suggested Sybil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I think we ought to do that. But&mdash;the
snakes."</p>

<p>"Ah, the exclusive rock theory is already
exploded," said Sybil, with a laugh. "Yet even
snakes can't exist without water, can they? Just
the thought of the wrigglers makes me shudder,
but if they are really our co-inhabitants here we
won't be safe from them even on this shore. Have
we anything in the way of clubs?"</p>

<p>Orissa considered the question. Then she went
to the machine and with a wrench unfastened the
foot-bar, which was long enough to extend across
both seats and was made of solid steel. She also
took the bolts out of one of the levers, which when
released became an effective weapon of defense.
Thus armed, and feeling somewhat more secure,
the girls prepared to move inland to explore their
new habitation.</p>

<p>They found the climb over the loose rocks
adjoining the shore to be quite arduous, and aside
from the difficulties of the way they had to exercise
constant caution for fear of snakes. They
saw none of these dreaded reptiles, however, and
when they came to the hillocks they selected a path
between the two most promising and began the
ascent, keeping close together. So jagged were
the tumbled masses of rock and so irregular in
their formation that it was not a question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
walking so much as crawling, but with their leggings,
stout shoes and thick cloth skirts they were
fairly protected from injury.</p>

<p>The silence throughout the island was intense.
The girls spoke in hushed tones, awed by their
uncanny surroundings. From a clear sky the sun
beat down upon their heads and was refracted
from the rocks until the heat was oppressive.
Added to this a pungent, unrecognized odor
saluted their nostrils as they progressed inland.
"Reminds me of the smell of a drug store,"
asserted Sybil; but Orissa replied: "It's more
like the smell of a garage, I think."</p>

<p>After a long and weary climb they reached the
brow of the rock hills and were able to look down
into the "dip" or valley which lay between them
and the mountain. The center of the depression,
which was three or four miles across, appeared to
be quite free from rocks except in a few places
where one cropped up in the form of a hummock.
Elsewhere the surface seemed smooth and moist,
for it was covered with an oozy, stagnant slime
which was decidedly repulsive in appearance.</p>

<p>Looking beyond this forbidding valley they discovered
the first interesting thing they had yet
observed. At the right base of the far-away
mountain, lying between it and the sea, was a
patch of vivid green, crowning an elevation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
distinctly separated it from the central depression
of the island. It might be grass or underbrush,
this alluring greenery, but in any event it proved
a grateful sight to eyes wearied by the dull waste
of rocks. From the point where the girls stood
they could also see the top of a palm tree which
grew around the edge of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Orissa, drawing a long breath,
"there is the first sign of life&mdash;animal or vegetable&mdash;we
have found in this wilderness. That
tree must indicate water, Sybil."</p>

<p>"Whatever it indicates," was the reply, "yonder
bluff is a better place for our camp than the
bay where we floated ashore. How shall we get
to it, though? It will be a heart-breaking climb
cross-lots over these interminable rocks."</p>

<p>"An impossible climb," Orissa agreed. "I
think our best plan will be to go around the
island, following the sandy beach. It seems from
here as if that bluff drops sheer down to the sea,
but it will be much easier for us to climb a bluff
than to navigate these rocks. Let's go back and
try it."</p>

<p>Cautiously and laboriously they made their way
back to the beach, feeling considerably cheered
by what they had seen and reassured by the total
absence of the dreaded "wigglers." After resting
a little from their exertions they prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the more important journey of discovery. Sybil
carried some food and the bottle of lemonade,
while Orissa secured two straps from the a&euml;roplane
and the coil of wire. Then, still armed with
their steel bars, they set out along the beach.</p>

<p>Their first task was to climb the rocks of the
point which formed the bay, where it jutted out
from the shore. This being accomplished they
encountered another stretch of smooth beach,
which gradually circled around the north end of
the island. Here it was easy walking and they
made good progress, but the coast line was so
irregular that it wound in and out continually,
and in places huge boulders interrupted their
passage and obliged them either to climb or wade,
whichever seemed the most desirable.</p>

<p>"Already," sighed Sybil, "we have tramped a
thousand miles. Did you mark that place, Orissa,
so we will know when we come to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I can tell it by the position of the sun.
That side of the island faces the northwest."</p>

<p>"And we haven't passed it?"</p>

<p>"No; but we must be drawing near to it. I've
been looking for the bluff the last half hour. The
green place was quite elevated, you remember,
and must be well above the sea level. Look ahead;
you'll notice the rocks are gradually rising, from
here on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Sybil nodded and again they trudged on. As
the rocks grew higher at their left, the girls kept
to the narrow strip of beach, which was beginning
to be washed by an occasional wave.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising," announced Orissa; "but
we shall be at the bluff very soon, and can then
climb above this moisture. Feet wet, Syb?"</p>

<p>"Pickled in brine. Wet feet signify a cold;
cold signifies la grippe; la grippe signifies a doctor;
the doctor signifies a depleted bank account.
Science of deduction, Ris. It's only a step from
wet feet to poverty."</p>

<p>"I prefer a doctor to an undertaker," said
Orissa, "but as neither profession is represented
here I advise you to forego the pleasure of taking
cold."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Cap'n Columbus. No doctor,
no cold. Banish the thought! We can't afford
the luxury of illness, can we? Oh, here's the
bluff."</p>

<p>There it was, indeed; but absolutely unclimbable.
It was sixty feet high, at least, and overhanging
the sea like a shelf, the waves having cut
it away at the base.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Orissa, after a careful
inspection, "we must either go back or go on, in
order to find a way up. As we haven't passed any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
steps or easy inclines, I propose we advance
farther and see what the west end looks like."</p>

<p>"I'll follow the leader; but the waves are
already covering the beach," asserted Sybil, with
a grimace.</p>

<p>"Then let us wade; and don't lose any precious
time, for the tide will come in faster every minute.
Shoes off, Crusoe!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Columbus."</p>

<p>With shoes, leggings and stockings in hand they
began the advance, hugging the wall of rock and
proceeding as swiftly as they could. At times one
or the other would cry out as she stepped on a
sharp bit of rock, but this was no time to shrink
from petty trials and they bore up with admirable
fortitude.</p>

<small>TWO GIRLS AND ONE ISLAND</small></h2>


<p>Plodding along the narrow ledge of beach and
constantly soused by the waves, the girls began
to fear, as afterward proved to be fact&mdash;that the
bluff covered the entire west end of the island.
The water beneath their feet grew deeper and
the undertow stronger with every step they
advanced, but fortunately for their safety they
finally came to a crevasse that split the bluff in
twain, and down this rift trickled a rill of pure
water.</p>

<p>They both exclaimed with delight as they crept
into the shelter of the crevasse. The fissure was
not level, but extended upward at an acute angle,
yet there was room enough at its mouth for the
girls to creep above the wash of the waves. Examining
the place carefully, Orissa thought they
might be able to follow the rift up to the top of
the bluff, and so at once they began the ascent.
The two walls were so close together that they
could touch both by extending their arms, and
there was room, by stepping occasionally into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
shallow brook, for them to climb from shelf to
shelf without much difficulty. At the very top, however,
they were brought to an abrupt halt. A
waterfall leaped from the edge of the bluff, dropping
a good ten feet to the point they had now
reached, from whence there seemed no way of
gaining the top.</p>

<p>Orissa and Sybil looked at each other and
laughed, the spray from the waterfall wetting
their cheeks, which were now rosy from exercise.</p>

<p>"Trapped, Cap'n!" cried Sybil, merrily.
"What next?"</p>

<p>"We can't go back, you know."</p>

<p>"Not unless we prefer Davy Jones' locker
to this stronghold&mdash;which I, for one, don't.
Therefore, let's eat."</p>

<p>"That seems your resource in every emergency,
Sybil."</p>

<p>"Naturally. Feasting stimulates thought;
thought develops wit; wit finds a way."</p>

<p>Orissa raised herself to a seat upon a projecting
crag and then, swinging her feet, proceeded to
think while Sybil brought out the food.</p>

<p>"Could you climb a wire, Syb?"</p>

<p>"Not without years of practice. Have you positively
decided to establish a circus in these wilds,
Ris?"</p>

<p>Orissa stood upon the crag, examined the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of the rock and then drove the end of the bar she
carried into a small fissure that was nearly
on a level with her head. Sybil observed the
horizontal bar and laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>"Have a sandwich, chummie, and curb your
imagination," said she. "I catch your idea, but
respectfully decline to accept the hazard."</p>

<p>Orissa ate her sandwich and drank from the
bottle of lemonade. Then she rinsed her fingers in
the brook, dried them on her handkerchief and
again mounted the crag.</p>

<p>"Listen, Crusoe: I'm going to make an attempt
to break out of jail," she said impressively. "If
I can reach to the top I'll find some way to get you
up. As soon as I get my feet on that bar, you
are to come up on this crag and hand me your
lever. If I can find a pocket to stick that into, the
deed is done."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Ris! What a pity you haven't any
spangles on your skirt. If you fall, fall gradually,
for I'll be afraid to catch you."</p>

<p>Orissa's fingers clutched at the rough projections
of rock and with some difficulty she gained
a footing on the bar. Then, still clinging to the
face of the rift, she made a further examination.
There seemed a small hole at the right, about
breast high, and she called for the lever. This
Sybil promptly passed up. Orissa thrust in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
lever and the next instant nearly lost her footing,
for with a bewildering hoot a white owl of monstrous
size fluttered out and tumbled almost at
Sybil's feet, who uttered a shriek like an Indian
war whoop. The creature was blinded by the
glare of day and went whirling down the incline
of the crevasse until it was lost to sight.</p>

<p>"First sign of life," called Sybil. "Don't look
so scared, Ris; there's nothing more harmless
than an owl."</p>

<p>"Did you yell because <i>I</i> was scared?" inquired
Orissa.</p>

<p>"No, I was reproving the owl, who has a voice
like a steam calliope. It would take more than
a blind bird to scare either of us; wouldn't it,
Cap'n?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish it hadn't been so&mdash;so unexpected,"
muttered Orissa, feeling her way up to the second
projection. With her feet on the lever she found
her head well above the edge of the precipice and
the first glance showed her a good hold for her
hands.</p>

<p>Orissa Kane was no skilled athlete, but her
experience in Steve's workshop, together with her
a&euml;rial exercises and constant outdoor life, had
given her well developed muscles which now stood
her in good stead. She drew herself up, got her
knee on the edge of the rock, and a moment later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was on level ground at the top of the bluff. Then
she leaned over and called to Sybil:</p>

<p>"Can you manage it?"</p>

<p>"What a question!" retorted Sybil, indignantly.
"I stood below to catch you in case you
slipped; but who is there to catch <i>me</i>, I beg to
inquire?"</p>

<p>"The owl," said Orissa. "Will you try it?"</p>

<p>"Is it worth while? Tell me what you've found
up there."</p>

<p>Orissa turned and examined the scene now
spread before her.</p>

<p>"Better come up, Syb," she said. "But wait a
moment and I'll help you."</p>

<p>She attached one of the straps to the coil of
steel wire and passed the end down to her chum.</p>

<p>"Buckle the strap around you&mdash;just under your
arms," she called. "I'll hold fast the wire at
this end. You can't fall, then; but be careful,
just the same."</p>

<p>With this support Sybil gained confidence.
Exercising extreme caution she followed Orissa's
example in scaling the cliff and as fast as she
mounted her companion took up the slack in the
wire and kept it taut. As soon as Sybil stood on
the upper bar Orissa grasped her arms and drew
her up beside her in safety.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed triumphantly. "Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
there's a will, there's a way. It wasn't such a
difficult feat, after all."</p>

<p>"There isn't enough money in the world to hire
me to do it again," panted Sybil, trembling a
little from the giddy experience.</p>

<p>"That may be true, but if our safety requires
it we may repeat the performance more than
once," declared Orissa. "Unfortunately, we have
lost our weapons of defense."</p>

<p>"Can't we recover the bars?"</p>

<p>"Not without going down for them. If you
think you could lower me over the edge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I just couldn't, Ris. Don't mention it."</p>

<p>"Very well; then we will proceed unarmed.
Look, Sybil! Isn't it a glorious prospect?"</p>

<p>"In point of comparison, yes," admitted Sybil,
speaking slowly as she gazed around her.</p>

<p>They were standing on a level table-land which
lay between the base of the mountain and the sea.
The "mountain" was really a great hill of rock,
rising only a hundred and fifty feet or so from the
table-land. The level space before them was
clothed with a queer sort of verdure. It was
not grass, but plants with broad and rather
crinkly leaves, so tender that wherever the girls
stepped the leaves were broken and crushed. Nor
was the color an emerald green; it was rather a
pale pea-green and the plants grew not in soil but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
sprang from tiny cracks and fissures in a sort of
shale, or crushed slate, which was constantly kept
moist by the seepage of the little stream.</p>

<p>The island here made an abrupt curve to the
west and a little farther along the girls saw
patches of bushes and several small groups of
tall, tropical trees, resembling plantains, or palms.
There were vines, too, which grew in rank profusion
among the rocks and helped relieve the
dismal landscape by their greenery. But nowhere
appeared any earth, or natural soil; whatever
grew, grew among the crushed rock, or shale,
which seemed to possess a certain fertility where
moisture reached it.</p>

<p>"This part of the island seems by far the best,"
asserted Sybil. "Let us explore it thoroughly."</p>

<p>They set out to skirt the edge of the bluff and
on reaching the first group of trees found they
were bananas. Several bunches of plump fruit
hung far up among the branches, quite out of
reach.</p>

<p>"We'll find a way to get at them if we are
detained here long enough to need them," said
Orissa.</p>

<p>A half mile beyond the place where they had so
laboriously climbed the bluff they came upon a
broad ravine which led directly down to the
water's edge. It appeared as if a huge mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
rock had at some time become detached from the
mountain and, sliding downward, had cut away
the bluff and hurled itself into the sea, where it
now lay a few rods from the water's edge and
formed a sort of breakwater. The swirl of the
waves around this mass of rock had made a small
indentation in the shore, creating a tiny bay with
a sandy beach.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Orissa, examining this place, "here
is where we must establish our camp; there is
room enough to float our boat into the bay, where
the water is calm, and on that smooth beach I
can repair the Hy at my leisure."</p>

<p>"Also, from this elevation," added Sybil, "we
can fly a flag of distress, which would be seen by
any ship approaching the island."</p>

<p>Orissa nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Here is also water and food," said she. "If
we can manage to navigate the Hy to this
place we have little to fear from a temporary
imprisonment."</p>

<p>"We must wait for low tide before we start
back," observed Sybil. "Meantime, let's run
down to the beach and see how it looks."</p>

<p>The descent to the water's edge was easy, and
they found the little bay ideal for their purpose.
But they could hear the waves breaking with some
force against the face of the cliff, just outside their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
retreat, and it would be hours before they might
venture to return to the other side of the island.</p>

<p>So again they ascended the bluff and selected
a place for their camp, beneath the spreading
foliage of the tall bananas. Afterward they sought
the source of the little brook, which was high up
on the mountain and required a difficult climb to
reach it. A spring seemed to well up, clear and
refreshing, from a cleft in the rock, but even at its
source there was no more water than would run
from an ordinary house faucet.</p>

<p>"Isn't it astonishing," said Orissa, "how much
moisture is dispersed from this tiny stream? I
think it never rains here and this spring of water
supplies all the island."</p>

<p>"This part of it, anyhow. It's mighty lucky for
us the babbling brook is here," declared Sybil,
drinking deeply of the cool water and then bathing
her heated brow with it. "But what stumps
me, Ris, is the lack of any life on the island. With
water and green stuff both animals and birds
might thrive here&mdash;to say nothing of bugs and
lizards and serpents galore&mdash;yet aside from that
great white owl we've not seen a living thing."</p>

<p>"It really <i>is</i> curious," admitted Orissa. Then,
turning her gaze seaward, she exclaimed: "See
there, Sybil! Isn't that another island?"</p>

<p>"It surely is," was the reply; "and only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
miles away. It's a big island, too, Ris&mdash;far bigger
than this. Did you bring along your glasses?"</p>

<p>"No; they are in the boat."</p>

<p>"When we get them we can inspect that island
better. Perhaps we could manage to get to it,
Ris."</p>

<p>"We'll see," was the doubting answer. "I
imagine, if that island is so much larger, and
proves to be more fertile than this, that we have
discovered the reason why the live things, such as
birds and animals, prefer it as a place of
residence."</p>

<p>They made their way back to the bluff and
waited patiently for the tide to ebb. According to
Orissa's watch it was quite four o'clock before
they deemed it safe to venture on the sands, and
even then they went barefooted, as an occasional
wave still crossed their narrow path.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the bay and their boat
the two girls were very tired with their long
tramp and as it was nearly sundown they decided
to spend the night in this location and make the
attempt to shift camp next day.</p>

<p>While daylight lasted Orissa was busy examining
the injury to the Aircraft and attempting a
few preliminary repairs. Her long mechanical
experience in the workshop with her brother
enabled her to determine accurately what was
required to put the machine into proper working
order, and she thought she could accomplish the
task.</p>

<p>"I can't see that it matters, anyhow," said
Sybil, watching her chum from a seat upon the
sands. "We can't fly, and the boat is our only
refuge. Even that we must manage to row or
sail in some way."</p>

<p>"All very true," returned Orissa, "but I can
see no object in neglecting these repairs when I
am able to make them. I can take off the bent
elevator rods and straighten them, after which
the elevator and rudder may assist us in sailing,
as we can oppose them to the wind. The engine
control is a more serious matter, for the wheel
connection was broken off short. But I shall take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a rod from a support and fit it in place and then
replace the support with our steel wire. That is
a sort of makeshift and will require time and nice
adjustment, but I can do it, all right. The tools
Steve supplied were quite complete; there's even
a box marked 'soldering outfit.'"</p>

<p>"Is there?" asked Sybil, eagerly. "See if any
matches are in it, Ris."</p>

<p>"Matches?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The lack of matches has disturbed me
considerably."</p>

<p>"Why, Syb?"</p>

<p>"We can't cook without them."</p>

<p>"Cook! why, I never thought of such a thing,"
said Orissa, truly astonished. "What is there to
cook, in this place?"</p>

<p>"Fish," answered Sybil.</p>

<p>"And what would you use for fuel?"</p>

<p>"Fuel?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what is there to make a fire with?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Just see about the matches."</p>

<p>Orissa opened the soldering case and found an
alcohol torch, a flask of alcohol, solder, acid and a
box of matches.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Sybil, joyfully. "Don't you
dare do any wasteful soldering, Orissa Kane. Save
every drop of that alcohol to cook with."</p>

<p>Orissa laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have nothing to solder, just yet," said she.
"And you've nothing to fry."</p>

<p>"I soon shall have, though," was the confident
reply. "We've assured ourselves of one thing,
Miss Columbus, and that is that we can sustain
life, in case of necessity, on bananas and spring
water. So I propose we have one good, luxuriant
square meal this evening by way of variety.
We've done nothing but lunch for two whole days
and I want something hot."</p>

<p>"I'm willing, Sybil. Can you catch a fish?"</p>

<p>"If there's one in our neighborhood. I'll try
it while you are tinkering."</p>

<p>Among the tools was a ball of stout cord, and
for hook Sybil cut a short length of wire and bent
it into shape with a pair of nippers, filing a sharp
point to it. Then she opened a can of chipped
beef and secured a couple of slices for bait. Going
to the point of rock she found a place on the ocean
side where a projecting shelf afforded her a seat
above fairly deep water, and here she dropped
her line.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford was an enthusiastic fisherman
and while Sybil had never cared particularly for
the sport she had accompanied her father on many
a piscatorial expedition.</p>

<p>A tug. The girl hauled in, hand over hand, and
found she had captured a large crab, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dropped from the hook to the rocks and with
prodigious speed made for the water and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Good riddance, old ugly!" laughed Sybil.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she thrown her line when another
tug came. A second crab floundered upon the
rocks, but fell upon his back and lay struggling
to turn himself.</p>

<p>Sybil ruefully contemplated the empty hook.</p>

<p>"I can't feed all our good beef to horrid crabs,"
she exclaimed; "but the beef seems a good bait
and I'll try again."</p>

<p>Another crab. Orissa came clambering over the
rocks to her friend's side. The sun was sinking.</p>

<p>"What luck, Syb?"</p>

<p>"Only three crabs. I'm afraid it's too shallow
here for fish."</p>

<p>Orissa leaned over the still struggling crab&mdash;the
only one that had not escaped.</p>

<p>"Why, we pay big money in Los Angeles for
these things," said she. "They're delicious eating;
but they have to be boiled, I think, and then
cracked and newburged or creamed."</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on the rascal, then," said Sybil.
"Can't he be eaten just boiled?"</p>

<p>"Yes; with mayonnaise."</p>

<p>"There's none handy. Let the high-brow go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and we'll fish for something that doesn't require
royal condiments."</p>

<p>But Orissa weighted the crab with a heavy
stone, to hold him down. Then she sat beside
Sybil and watched her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid our fish dinner must be postponed,"
began Miss Cumberford, sorrowfully; but at that
moment the line jerked so fiercely that she would
have been pulled from her seat had not Orissa
made a grab and rescued her. Then they both
clung to the line, managing to draw it in by
degrees until there leaped from the water a great
silvery fish which promptly dove again, exhibiting
a strength that nearly won for him his
freedom.</p>

<p>"Hold fast!" gasped Sybil, exerting all her
strength. "We mustn't let him escape."</p>

<p>The fish, a twelve-pound rockcod, made a desperate
fight; but unfortunately for him he had
swallowed the entire hook and so his conquest
was certain if the girls could hold on to the line.
At last he lay flopping upon the rocks, and seeing
he was unable to disgorge the hook, they dragged
him to the beach, where Orissa shut her eyes and
beheaded him with a hatchet from the tool chest.</p>

<p>In the outfit of the chest, which had evidently
been intended by Steve and Mr. Cumberford for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>regular use in connection with the Hydro-Aircraft,
they had found two aluminum plates, as
well as knives and forks and spoons. Sybil cut
two generous slices from the big fish and laid them
upon one of the metal plates. Then they opened
a can of pork and beans and secured a lump of fat
to use in frying. Orissa lighted the alcohol torch
and Sybil arranged some loose rocks so that they
would support the plate suspended above the
flame of the torch. The intense heat melted the
fat and the fish was soon fried to a lovely brown.
They ate it with biscuits and washed it down with
ginger ale, confiding the while to one another that
never had they eaten a meal so delicious.</p>

<p>They let the torch flicker during the repast, for
night had fallen, but when from motives of economy
Orissa had extinguished the flame they found
a dim light suffused from a myriad of stars.
Later a slender crescent moon arose, so they were
able to distinguish near-by objects, even with the
shadow of the bleak mountain behind them.</p>

<p>They had arranged their blankets in the boat
and were sitting upon them, talking together in
the starlight, when suddenly an unearthly cry
smote their ears, followed by an answering shriek&mdash;then
another, and another&mdash;until the whole
island seemed echoing with a thousand terrifying
whoops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ku-whoo-woo-oo-oo! Ku-whoo! Ku-whoo-oo!"</p>

<p>The two girls clung together tremblingly as the
great chorus burst upon them; but after a moment
Sybil pushed her companion away with a nervous
little laugh.</p>

<p>"Owls!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Orissa, relieved as the truth dawned
upon her. "I&mdash;I thought it was savages."</p>

<p>"So it is. I challenge any beings to yell more
savagely than those fearful hoot owls. Something
must have happened to them, Ris, for
they've never made a mutter all day long."</p>

<p>"Because they have been asleep," answered
Orissa. They had to speak loudly to be heard
above the turmoil of shrieks, although the owls
seemed mainly congregated upon the distant
mountain. The rocks everywhere were full of
them, however, and hoots and answering hoots
resounded from every part of the island. It was
fairly deafening, as well as annoying and uncanny.
They waited in vain for the noise to subside.</p>

<p>"There must be thousands of them," observed
Sybil. "What's the row about, do you suppose!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's their nature to, Syb. I wonder
why we didn't hear the pests last night. When
we wakened this morning all was silent as the
grave."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think we floated into the bay about daylight,
when all the big-eyes had ducked into their holes.
Do you know, Ris, the owls must be responsible
for the absence of all other life on the island?
They dote on snakes and lizards and beetles and
such, and they'd rob the nests of any other birds,
who couldn't protect themselves in the nighttime.
So I suppose they've either eaten up all the other
creatures or scared them to death."</p>

<p>"That must be so. But, oh, Sybil! if this racket
keeps up every night how are we going to be able
to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Ah. Just inquire, Cap'n, and if you find out,
let me know," replied Sybil, yawning. "I got up
so early this morning that I'm dead for sleep this
blessed minute."</p>

<p>"Lie down; I'll keep watch."</p>

<p>"Thank you. This lullaby is too entrancing to
miss."</p>

<p>The air grew cool presently, as it often does at
night in the semi-tropics, and the two girls
crouched down and covered themselves to their
ears with the blankets. That deadened the pandemonium
somewhat and as the owls showed no
tendency to abate their shrieks, an hour or two of
resigned submission to the inevitable resulted in
drowsiness, and finally in sleep. As Sybil said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
next morning, no one would have believed that
mortal girl could have slumbered under the affliction
of such ear-splitting yells; but sleep they did,
and when they wakened at daybreak profound
silence reigned.</p>

<small>MISS COLUMBUS AND MISS CRUSOE</small></h2>


<p>Sybil cooked more fish for their breakfast,
although Orissa objected to the extravagant
waste of alcohol. But her chum argued that they
must waste either the alcohol or the fish and
as they had a strenuous day before them a
substantial breakfast was eminently desirable.</p>

<p>They now packed the aluminum chest and made
arrangements for the voyage, for the sea in the
bay was smooth as glass and the ocean seemed
nearly as quiet outside. Orissa had straightened
and repaired the elevator rods and firmly bolted
the chest in its original position, but the control
must be a matter of future tinkering, the rod
needed for its repair being at present stuck in
the side of the bluff.</p>

<p>It was easy to roll the machine down the beach
into the water and set it afloat, but the difficult
matter was to propel their queer, top-heavy craft
through the water. A quiet sea meant no wind,
nor could they feel the slightest breath of air stirring.
Oars they had none, nor any substitute for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
such things; nor could they find anything to pole
the boat along with.</p>

<p>"There's just one thing to be done," announced
Orissa, gravely, "and that is for us to take turns
wading behind the thing and pushing it along. By
keeping close to the shore we ought to be able to
accomplish our journey in that way."</p>

<p>"Suppose we strike deep water?" suggested
Sybil.</p>

<p>"We'll stay close to shore. There seems to be
a beach all the way."</p>

<p>"I'm game to try," declared Sybil, in a brisk
tone, "but it seems at first sight like an impossible
task. I'm glad, Miss Columbus, that under
these circumstances your island is uninhabited&mdash;except
by owls who can't see in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Were there other inhabitants," returned
Orissa, "we would not be undertaking such a
thing. The natives would either eat us or assist
us."</p>

<p>"True for you, Cap'n. I'm going to keep my
stockings on. They'll be some protection against
those sharp rocks which we're liable to tread on."</p>

<p>"I shall do the same," said Orissa. "Take
your seat in the boat, Syb, and I'll do the first
stunt shoving. After we get around the point I
will give you a chance to wade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unanimously carried," said Sybil.</p>

<p>This undertaking did not appear nearly so preposterous
to the two castaways as it may to the
reader sitting quietly at home. Except that circumstances
had made Orissa and Sybil a&euml;ronauts
at a time when few girls have undertaken to fly
through the air&mdash;as many will do in the future&mdash;they
were quite like ordinary girls in all respects.
A capricious fate had driven them into a far-away,
unknown sea and cast them upon an uninviting
island, but in such unusual circumstances they did
what any girls would do, if they're the right sort;
kept their courage and exercised every resource
to make the most of their discouraging surroundings
and keep alive until succor arrived.</p>

<p>So far, these two castaways had shown admirable
stamina. Had either one been placed in
such a position alone, the chances are she might
have despaired and succumbed to girlish terrors,
but being together their native pride forbade
their admitting or even showing a trace of fear.
In this manner they encouraged and supported
one another, outwardly calm, whatever their
inward tremors might be.</p>

<p>Orissa Kane was habitually dainty and feminine
in both appearance and deportment, yet possessed
a temperament cool and self-reliant. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
natural cleverness and quickness of comprehension
had been fostered by constant association
with her mechanical, inventive brother, and it
seemed to her quite proper to help herself when
no one was by to render her aid. To wade in the
warm, limpid water of the Pacific, at a place far
removed from the haunts of humanity, in order
to propel the precious craft on which her life and
that of her companion might depend, to a better
location, seemed to this girl quite the natural
thing to do. Sybil's acute sense of humor led
her to recognize the laughable side of this queer
undertaking; yet even Sybil, much more frail and
dependent than her beloved chum, had no thought
of refusing her assistance.</p>

<p>The aluminum boat rode lightly upon the surface
of the sea, the broad, overhanging planes
scarcely interfering with its balance. Indeed, the
planes probably assisted in keeping the boat
upright. Orissa, knee-deep in the water, was
not called upon to exert herself more than to
wade; but this was a slow and tedious process and
required frequent rests. At such times she would
sit in the back of the boat and let her feet dangle
in the warm water.</p>

<p>Gradually the Hy was propelled around the
point of rock into the open sea, and by keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
close to shore the girl seldom found herself out
of her depth, and then only temporarily.</p>

<p>Sybil kept up a constant chatter, inducing
Orissa frequently to laugh with her, and that
made the task seem more an amusement than
hard labor. They took turns at the wading, as
had been agreed upon, but because Orissa was
much the stronger her periods of playing mermaid
were longer than those of her chum.</p>

<p>In this manner they made good progress, and
though Sybil made a great deal of fun of what
she called her "patent propeller," she took her
turn at wading very seriously and pushed the
strange craft through the water at a good rate of
speed. By midday they reached the point where
the bluff began to rise and here they sat together
in the boat, shaded by the planes, and ate their
luncheon with hearty appetites. They found it
high tide, yet the water was more quiet than on
the preceding day, and when they resumed their
journey their progress was much more rapid than
before.</p>

<p>By two o'clock they had cautiously propelled
the boat around the huge boulder that marked
the ravine they had found and soon after had
rolled it upon the sandy beach and anchored it
securely beyond the reach of the tide.</p>

<p>"If it would fly," said Orissa, "I think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
could push it to the top of the bluff; but if we
use it at all, before our friends arrive, it must be
as a boat, and not an a&euml;roplane."</p>

<p>"Then," returned Sybil, "let's remove the canvas
from the lower plane and make a tent of it."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that," said Orissa, "and
I'm sure it is a wise thing to do. I know how to
take the clips off, and it won't injure the cloth in
the least."</p>

<p>"Then get busy, and I'll help you."</p>

<p>So, after a good rest on the beach in the sun they
resumed their clothing. The wet stockings were
thoroughly dried by the sun by the time they were
ready for them, and presently they set to work
removing the cloth from the lower plane. The
task was almost completed when Sybil suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How about a frame for our tent?"</p>

<p>Orissa looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Come up on the bluff," she proposed.</p>

<p>The incline was not at all difficult and they
soon stood on top the bluff. A thorough examination
of the place disclosed no means of erecting
the tent. A few dead branches that had fallen
from the banana trees lay scattered about and
there was a quantity of anæmic shrubbery growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>here and there, but there was nothing to furnish
poles for the tent or to support it in any
way.</p>

<p>"Stumped, Columbus!" laughed Sybil, as they
squatted together in the shade of the trees. "We
shall have to drag up the a&euml;roplane, after all, and
use the plane-frame for our ridge-pole."</p>

<p>Orissa demurred at this.</p>

<p>"There is always a way to do a thing, if one
can think how," she said.</p>

<p>"In this case, chummie dear, magic or legerdemain
seems the only modus operandi," maintained
Sybil. But Orissa was thinking, and as
she thought she glanced at the trees.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sybil's eyes questioned her gravely.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Orissa, jumping up.</p>

<p>"Not a step, Miss Columbus, until I'm enlightened."</p>

<p>"Oh, Crusoe, can't you see? It is so extremely
simple that I'm ashamed of our stupidity. We've
but to stretch our coil of wire between these two
trees, throw the canvas over it and weight the
bottom with rocks to hold it in place."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed.</p>

<p>"It was <i>too</i> easy," she admitted. "I never
<i>could</i> guess an easy conundrum; but give me a
hard nut to crack and I'm a regular squirrel."</p>

<p>They returned to the beach for the canvas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
wire and Orissa took several of the clips, with
which to fasten together the ends of their tent.
Ascending once more, this time heavily loaded,
to the group of bananas on the bluff, they proceeded
to attach the wire to two of the trees. The
plane-cover was large enough to afford a broad
spread to their "A" tent and when the lower
edges were secured by means of heavy stones,
and the scattered rocks cleared away from the
interior, their new domicile seemed roomy and
inviting.</p>

<p>Their next task was to fetch the aluminum
chest from the beach, and after they had lightened
its weight by leaving in the boat all the tools
except the hatchet and a small hack saw, they were
able to carry the chest between them, although
forced to make frequent stops to rest.</p>

<p>"The lack of a bedstead worries me most,"
remarked Sybil. "I don't like the idea of sleeping
on the bare ground. How would it do, Ris,
to build a stone bed&mdash;something like an altar,
you know, with a hollow center which we could
fill with sand?"</p>

<p>"That is a capital idea, Crusoe, and will help
clear our front yard of some of those flat stones.
They are mostly slate, I think, instead of rock
formation. Heave-ho, my hearty, and we'll do
the job in a jiffy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls lugged into the tent a number of
stones of such size as they could comfortably
move, and then Orissa, who could put her hand
to almost any sort of work, planned and built the
extraordinary bedstead. It was laid solid, at first,
but when about a foot from the ground she began
to extend the sides of the pile and leave a hollow
in the middle. This hollow they afterward filled
with sand, carrying it in their dress-skirts from
the beach. When finally the "Altar to Morpheus"&mdash;as
Sybil persisted in calling it&mdash;was
completed, they spread their blankets upon it
and it made a very comfortable place to sleep.</p>

<p>They also erected a small rock stove, for there
was enough firewood to be gathered, in the way
of fallen branches, dead leaves and "peelings"
from the tree-trunks, to last them for several
days. The hatchet and hack saw helped prepare
these scraps to fit the stove and by sundown the
girls felt quite settled in their new residence.</p>

<p>"We ought to fly a flag of distress from some
place high up on those trees," observed Orissa;
"but we've no flag and no way to shin up the
tree."</p>

<p>"Couldn't any ship see our white tent from the
ocean?" asked Sybil.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think so."</p>

<p>"As for climbing the tree," continued Sybil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
"I wish your creative brain would evolve some
way to do it. Those fat, yellow bananas look
mighty tempting and they would serve to eke out
our larder. Supplies are beginning to diminish
with alarming rapidity, Ris. Only a box and a
half of those biscuits left."</p>

<p>"I know," said Orissa, soberly. "To-morrow
we will see what may be done to capture the
bananas."</p>

<p>After a time Sybil said, softly: "By to-morrow
we may begin to look for Daddy and Steve.
Of course it will take them some time to find us,
but&mdash;&mdash;Don't you think, Orissa, they're quite
certain to find us, in the end?"</p>

<p>Orissa looked at her companion with a gleam
of pity in her deep blue eyes; but she had no
desire to disturb Sybil's confidence in their rescue,
whatever misgivings oppressed her own
heart.</p>

<p>"I believe they will find us," she affirmed. "It
may not be to-morrow, you know, nor in a week,
nor&mdash;perhaps&mdash;in a month&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Orissa!"</p>

<p>"But they'll cover the entire Pacific in their
search, I am positive, and sooner or later they'll
come to this island and&mdash;take us away."</p>

<p>"Alive or dead," added Sybil, gloomily.</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that, we are perfectly safe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
healthy&mdash;so far&mdash;and I imagine we could live for
a long time on this island, if obliged to."</p>

<p>Again they sat silently thinking, while twilight
gave way to darkness and darkness was relieved
by the pale moonlight.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shriek sounded in their ears. A
great white bird swooped down from the mountain
and passed directly between their two
heads, disappearing into the night with another
appalling cry. This shriek was answered by
another and another, until the whole island
resounded with the distracting "Ku-whoo-oo!"</p>

<p>"The owls are awake," said Orissa, rising
resignedly. "Come into the tent, Sybil. I'm not
sure they wouldn't attack us if we remained in
the open."</p>

<small>MADELINE DENTRY'S PROPOSITION</small></h2>


<p>At the aviation field the crowd had watched the
departure of the two girls, flying the famous
Kane Hydro-Aircraft, with eager interest but
assured confidence in their making a successful
trip. The Flying Girl never indulged in accidents,
and her skill was universally admitted.
To be sure, there was an added risk in flying over
the water, but with a motor boat to sustain them
when they alighted, the danger was reduced to a
minimum and, in the minds of nearly all the spectators,
a triumphant return was unquestioned.
Hundreds of glasses followed the flight and
although the management sent several bird-men
into the air to amuse the throng the real interest
remained centered on the dim speck that marked
the course of the Flying Girl.</p>

<p>No sooner had Orissa and Sybil started on
their voyage than Stephen Kane and Mr. Cumberford
ran to the bluff overlooking the sea,
where with powerful binoculars they could obtain
an unobstructed view of the entire trip to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
island and back again. Presently Madeline Dentry
joined them, in company with Mr. and Mrs.
Tupper, all standing silently with leveled glasses.</p>

<p>"She's working beautifully," muttered Steve,
referring to his invention with boyish delight.
"I'm sorry Ris didn't make a straight line of it,
but she always likes to give the dear public the
worth of their money.... Ah-h!"</p>

<p>"By Jove! that was an awkward turn," cried
Mr. Cumberford, as they saw the Aircraft keel
at a dangerous angle and then slowly right itself.
"I'm surprised at Orissa. She usually makes her
turns so neatly."</p>

<p>"I've an idea that blamed steering gear stuck,"
said Steve, ruefully. "I've been a little afraid
of it, all along. But the girls are all right now.
They're headed dead for the island and if Orissa
makes a neat drop to the water the rest is easy."</p>

<p>No one spoke again for a time, all being intent
upon the flying-machine. When it had seemed to
reach the island, and even to pass over it, without
a halt, there was an excited hum of amazement
from the grand stand.</p>

<p>Madeline glanced at Stephen Kane's face and
found it as white as a sheet. He was staring with
dilated eyes toward the Aircraft.</p>

<p>"What in the mischief is Orissa up to now?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>questioned Mr. Cumberford, uneasily. "Wasn't
she to alight this side of the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Steve hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;She can't be joking, or playing
pranks. It isn't like her. Why, they haven't
swerved a hair's breadth from the course, or even
slackened speed. They&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're in trouble, I'm afraid," said Steve in
trembling tones. "The control has failed them
and they can't stop."</p>

<p>"Can't stop!" The little line of observers on
the bluff echoed the thrilling words. From the
grand stand came a roar of voices filled with tense
excitement. Some thought the Flying Girl was
attempting a reckless performance, with the idea
of shocking the crowd; but Stephen Kane knew
better, and so did Mr. Cumberford. As the two
men held their glasses to their eyes with shaking
hands, straining to discover a sign that Orissa
had altered her course and was coming back,
Madeline Dentry turned to look earnestly at the
brother and father of the girls, knowing she could
read the facts more truly from their faces than
by focusing her own glasses on that tiny speck
in the sky.</p>

<p>The moments dragged slowly, yet laden with
tragic import. The powerful lenses lost the speck,
now found it again&mdash;lost it for good&mdash;yet the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
most affected by this strange occurrence still
glared at the sky, hoping against hope that their
fears were unfounded and that the Aircraft would
come back.</p>

<p>Some one plucked Steve's sleeve. It was
Chesty Todd, his big body shaken like an aspen.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it has run away with 'em, Steve. It's
gone wrong, man; there's danger ahead!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Steve, dully.</p>

<p>"Wake up and do something!"</p>

<p>Steve lowered his glasses and looked helplessly
at Mr. Cumberford. Cumberford returned the
stare, glowering upon the inventor.</p>

<p>"That's right; it's up to you, Kane. What are
you going to do?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p>"There's no other hydro-a&euml;roplane on the
grounds," said the boy brokenly.</p>

<p>"Then get an a&euml;roplane," commanded Cumberford,
sharply.</p>

<p>"It would mean death to anyone who ventured
to follow our girls in an a&euml;roplane&mdash;not rescue
for them."</p>

<p>Cumberford moaned, as if in pain; then
stamped his foot impatiently, as if ashamed of
his weakness.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well! What then, Stephen Kane?" he
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve wrung his hands, realizing his helplessness.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Madeline Dentry, laying a
gentle hand on Mr. Cumberford's arm, "let me
help you. There is no reason for despair just
yet; the condition of those girls is far from desperate,
it seems to me. Did I understand you to
say, Mr. Kane, that your sister is unable to stop
the engine, or to turn the machine?"</p>

<p>Steve nodded.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "Something has broken.
I can't imagine what it is, but there's no other
way to explain the thing."</p>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Madeline, coolly, "let
us, then, try to consider intelligently what will
happen to them. Will they presently descend and
alight upon the surface of the water?"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm afraid not," Steve answered. "If
that were possible, Orissa would have done it long
ago. I think something has happened to affect
the control, and therefore my sister is helpless."</p>

<p>"In that case, how long will they continue flying?"
persisted Madeline.</p>

<p>"As long as the gasoline lasts&mdash;three or four
hours."</p>

<p>"And how fast are they traveling, Mr. Kane?"</p>

<p>"I think at the rate of about forty-five miles
an hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Dentry made a mental calculation.</p>

<p>"Then they will descend about a hundred and
fifty miles from here, in a straight line over that
island," said she. "Having a boat under them,
I suppose they will float indefinitely?"</p>

<p>Again Steve nodded, looking at the girl curiously
and wondering at her logic.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if they manage to alight upon the water
in good shape," he replied more hopefully,
"they'll be safe enough&mdash;for a time. And they
have food and water with them. The only danger
I fear for them, at present, is that when the gasoline
is exhausted the machine will be wrecked."</p>

<p>"Don't you aviators often shut off your engine
and volplane to the ground?" asked Madeline.</p>

<p>"Yes, with the elevator and rudder in full control.
But that isn't the case with Orissa. I'm
certain her elevator control has bound in some
way. Were it broken, and free, the Aircraft would
have wobbled, and perhaps tumbled while we were
looking at it. The elevator is wedged, you see,
and my sister can't move it at all. So, when the
gasoline gives out, I&mdash;I'm not sure how the
machine will act."</p>

<p>"Anyway," exclaimed Madeline, with sudden
determination, "we are wasting valuable time in
useless talk. Follow me at once."</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Steve, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"To my yacht. I'm going after the girls.
Please come with us, Mr. Cumberford&mdash;and you,
too, Mr. Todd. Aunty," turning to Mrs. Tupper,
"if you require anything from the hotel for the
journey I will send you there in the car; but you
must hurry, for every moment is precious."</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford straightened up, animated and
alert, while his face brightened with a ray of
hope.</p>

<p>"We will take my car to the bay," said he,
eagerly, "and Mr. and Mrs. Tupper can use your
own car to visit the hotel. Will you accompany
us, or ride with your aunt?"</p>

<p>"With you," decided Madeline. "I must have
the captain get up steam and prepare to sail. It
won't take long; I've ordered them to keep a little
steam all the time, in case I wish to take a party
out for a ride."</p>

<p>Even as they were speaking all walked rapidly
toward the long line of motor cars. Mrs. Tupper,
who had not ventured a remark or made any protest&mdash;quite
contrary to her usual custom&mdash;now
astonished her niece by saying:</p>

<p>"Never mind the hotel; let us all go directly to
the yacht. With those two poor girls in danger
I couldn't bear to think I had caused a moment's
delay. It is very comfortable on the yacht and&mdash;we'll
get along all right for a day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure; to be sure," agreed Mr. Tupper,
nervously. "I shall be seasick; I'm bound to be
seasick; I always am; but in this emergency my
place is by Madeline's side."</p>

<p>Of course no protest would have affected Madeline's
determination, and the worthy couple recognized
that fact perfectly; hence they diplomatically
abetted her plan.</p>

<p>Captain Krell had attended the exhibitions at
the aviation field, but while there he kept one eye
on Miss Dentry. During the panic caused by
the runaway a&euml;roplane he saw Miss Dentry in
earnest conversation with Cumberford and Kane
and marked their hurried departure from the
field. So the gallant captain scuttled back to the
yacht at his best speed, to find Miss Dentry
already aboard and the engineer shoveling in coal.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Cumberford and Steve knew that the
<i>Salvador</i> was by odds the fastest ship in the bay,
and Madeline's prompt offer to go to the rescue
of their imperilled daughter and sister awakened
hope in their breasts and aroused their lively
gratitude.</p>

<p>After all it did not take the yacht long to get
under way. It was so perfectly manned and in
such complete readiness that steam was the only
requisite to begin a trip instantly. Madeline could
scarcely wait while with aggravating deliberation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
they hoisted anchor, but she became more composed
as the yacht slowly headed out of the bay,
the crew alert and the big captain as eager as
any of them to rescue the daring bird-maids.</p>

<p>By the time the <i>Salvador</i> reached the open sea
the shore was lined with thousands of spectators,
and the sight of the graceful yacht headed in
chase of the two girls raised a cheer so lusty and
heartfelt that it reached Madeline's ears and
caused her to flush with pleasure and renewed
determination.</p>

<small>A GAME OF CHECKERS</small></h2>


<p>"Nine o'clock!" cried Orissa, giving Sybil a
nudge. "Are you going to sleep all day, Crusoe,
like those dreadful owls?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to," muttered Miss Cumberford,
regretfully opening her eyes. "My, what a
blessed relief from that night of torture! Don't
you think, Ris, that those feathered fiends only
stopped the concert because they'd howled until
their throats were sore?"</p>

<p>"I fear we made a mistake in changing our
camp," returned Orissa, busy with her toilet.
"The shrieks sounded much louder than they did
the night before."</p>

<p>"Question is," said Sybil, rolling off the improvised
bed, "how long we are to endure this
imprisonment. If it's to be a mere day or so,
don't let's move again. However, if you think
we're here for life, I propose we murder every
owl and have done with them."</p>

<p>"We can't read the future, of course,"
remarked Orissa thoughtfully, as she stroked her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
beautiful hair with her back-comb&mdash;the only toilet
article she possessed. "Steve may get to us any
day, or he may have a hard time finding us. He
will never give up, though, nor will your father,
until our retreat is located and&mdash;and&mdash;our fate
determined."</p>

<p>"Poor Daddy!" sighed Sybil; "he'll be worried
to death. I've led him a dog's life, I know;
but he's just as fond and faithful as if I'd been
a dutiful daughter."</p>

<p>"I hope they won't tell mother," said Orissa.
"The anxiety would be so hard for her to bear.
<i>We</i> know we're fairly comfortable, Syb; but they
can't know that, nor have any clear idea what's
become of us."</p>

<p>They fell quiet, after this, and exchanged few
words until they were outside the tent and had
made a fire of twigs and leaves in the rock stove.
Sybil warmed the last of the baked beans, adding
a little water to moisten them. With these they
each ate a biscuit and finished their breakfast
with a draught of cool water from the spring.</p>

<p>After the meal they wandered among the queer
greenery they had before observed and Sybil
called attention to the fact that many of the broad,
tender leaves had been nibbled at the edges.</p>

<p>"The owls did that, of course," said Orissa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"and if it is good food for owls I'm sure it
wouldn't hurt us."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it look something like lettuce?" asked
Sybil.</p>

<p>"Yes; perhaps that is what it is&mdash;wild lettuce."</p>

<p>She plucked a leaf and tasted it. The flavor
was agreeable and not unlike that of lettuce.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sybil, after tasting the green,
"here's an item to add to our bill-of-fare. If
only we had dressing for it a salad would be
mighty appetizing."</p>

<p>"There's the vinegar in the bottle of pickles,"
proposed Orissa. "It won't go very far, but it
will help. Let us try the new dish for luncheon."</p>

<p>"And how about the bananas?" asked Miss
Cumberford.</p>

<p>"I'll proceed to get them right now," promised
Orissa, walking back to the group of trees.</p>

<p>The bare, smooth trunks extended twenty feet
in the air before a branch appeared. The
branches were broad, stout leaves, among which
hung the bunches of fruit.</p>

<p>"I hate to ruin a perfectly good tree," declared
Orissa, picking up the hatchet, "but self-preservation
is the first law of nature."</p>

<p>"Goodness me! You're not thinking of chopping
it down, I hope," exclaimed Sybil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; that would be too great a task to undertake.
I've a better way, I think."</p>

<p>She selected a tree that had three large bunches
of bananas on it. One bunch was quite ripe, the
next just showing color and the third yet an
emerald green. Each bunch consisted of from
sixty to eighty bananas.</p>

<p>First Orissa chopped notches on either side of
the trunk, at such distances as would afford support
for her feet. When these notches rose as
high as she could reach, she brought two broad
straps from the Aircraft, buckled them together
around the tree-trunk, and then passed the slack
around her body and beneath her arms. Thus
supported she began the ascent, placing her feet
in the notches she had already cut and chopping
more notches as she advanced.</p>

<p>In this manner the girl reached the lower
branches and after climbing into them removed
the strap and crept along until she reached the
first bunch of bananas.</p>

<p>"Stand from under!" she cried to Sybil and
began chopping at the stem. Presently the huge
bunch fell with a thud and Sybil gleefully
applauded by clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"The lower ones are a bit mushy, I fear," she
called to her chum, "but that can't be helped."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will eat those first," said Orissa, creeping
to the second bunch.</p>

<p>She managed to cut it loose, and the third, after
which she replaced the strap around her body and
cautiously descended to the ground. The two
girls then rolled over the ripest bunch and found
the damage confined to a couple of dozen bananas,
the skins of which had burst from the force of
the heavy fall. A moment later they were feasting
on the fruit, which they found delicious.</p>

<p>"I've read somewhere," said Sybil, "that
bananas alone will sustain life for an indefinite
period. They are filling and satisfying, and
they're wholesome. We needn't worry any longer
for fear of starvation, Ris."</p>

<p>"I imagine we'd get deadly tired of the things,
in time," replied Orissa; "but, as you say, they'll
sustain life, and just at present they taste mighty
good."</p>

<p>They drew the ripest bunch into the tent, but
left the others lying in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>"Now," announced Orissa, "we must make an
expedition to that crevasse and rescue the bar
and the lever, which we left sticking in the rocks.
The tide is low, so we may go around by way of
the shore."</p>

<p>A leisurely walk of fifteen minutes brought
them to the crevasse, down which tumbled the tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
brook. Orissa, as the most venturesome, climbed
to the bar, from whence she managed to pull the
lever out of the owl's nest into which she had
formerly thrust it. If the owl was hidden there
now it failed to disclose its presence and on
descending to the rocks Orissa easily released the
bar. So now, armed once more with their primitive
weapons, the girls returned to their camp.</p>

<p>"I can attach these to our machine at any
time," said the air-maid, "so I think it may be
best to keep them beside us, to use in case of
emergency. I haven't felt entirely safe since we
lost them."</p>

<p>"Nor I," returned Sybil. "We haven't
encountered anything dangerous, so far, but I
like to feel I've something to pound with, should
occasion arise."</p>

<p>That afternoon Orissa worked on the Aircraft,
repairing the damage caused by the sliding chest.
She also took apart the steering gear, filed the
bearings carefully, and afterward replaced the
parts, fitting them nicely together and greasing
them thoroughly. As a result of this labor the
gear now worked easily and its parts were not
likely again to bind.</p>

<p>"Steve made it altogether too light for its purpose,"
said the girl. "On the next machine I
must see that he remedies that fault."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Sybil had been lying half asleep on the sands,
shaded by the spreading plane of the Aircraft.
She now aroused herself and looked at her companion
with a whimsical expression while the
other girl carefully gathered up the tools and put
them away.</p>

<p>"All ready to run, Ris?" she asked.</p>

<p>"All ready."</p>

<p>"I suppose with the gasoline tanks filled we
could go home?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I think so. With the wind in our favor,
as it was when we came, we ought to cover the
same distance easily."</p>

<p>"Very good. I hope you are now satisfied,
having worked like a nailer for half a day, getting
a machine in order that can't be utilized.
Gasoline doesn't grow on this island, I imagine&mdash;unless
it could be made from bananas."</p>

<p>"No; it doesn't grow here."</p>

<p>"And none of the department stores keep it."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"But we've got a flying-machine, in apple-pie
order, except that we're using one of the plane
coverings for a tent and a lever for a weapon of
defense."</p>

<p>"Absolutely correct, Crusoe."</p>

<p>"Hooray. Let's go to sleep again, dear. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
screechers will keep us awake all night, you
know."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes drowsily and Orissa sat
beside her and looked thoughtfully over the
expanse of blue ocean. There was nothing in
sight; nothing save the big island at the west,
which seemed from this distance to be much more
desirable than the bleak rocks on which the
adventurers had stranded.</p>

<p>Orissa got her binoculars and made a careful
inspection of the place. Through the powerful
glasses she could discover forests, green meadowland
and the gleam of a small river. It was a flat
island, yet somewhat elevated above the surface
of the sea. She judged it to be at least four times
bigger than the island they were now on. The
distance rendered it impossible to discover
whether the place was inhabited or not. No
houses showed themselves, but of course she could
see only one side of the island from where she sat.</p>

<p>Orissa did not feel sleepy, in spite of her wakeful
night, so she took Sybil's fishline and baited
the hook with a scrap of beef. Going to the top
of the bluff she began to fish, and as she fished
she reviewed in mind all the conditions of their
misfortune and strove to find a way of relief.
Being unsuccessful in both occupations she finally
came back to the little bay and waded out to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
big rock that guarded the mouth of the inlet. On
the ocean side there was good depth of water and
in the course of the next half hour she landed a
huge crawfish, two crabs and a two-pound flat fish
resembling a sole. This last is known as "chicken-halibut"
and is delicious eating.</p>

<p>She aroused Sybil, and the two girls built a fire,
using dry twigs from the brushwood, a supply of
which they had gathered and placed near their
tent. In the fat taken from the crawfish they
fried the halibut for supper. Then among the
coals and hot stones they buried the crabs, keeping
a little fire above them until they were sure
the creatures were thoroughly roasted. Next day
they cracked the shells and picked out the meat,
deciding they might live luxuriously even on an
island of rocks, provided they exercised their
wits and took advantage of all conditions Nature
afforded them.</p>

<p>At dark thousands of great owls came from
their retreats among the rocks and flew ceaselessly
about the island, uttering their distracting
cries. Nor was there a moment's peace again
until daybreak. The birds were evidently in
search of food, and found it; but what it consisted
of the girls could not imagine. Singularly
enough, the castaways were growing accustomed
to the deafening clamor and as they felt quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
safe within their enclosed tent they were able to
sleep&mdash;in a fitful, restless way&mdash;a good part of
the night.</p>

<p>The following day they began to find the hours
dragging tediously, for the first time since their
captivity. Arm in arm the two girls wandered
around the elevated end of their island, exploring
it thoroughly but making no new discoveries of
importance. The barren, slimy hollow that lay
inland had no temptations to lure them near it
and so there remained little else to do but watch
the ocean and prepare their meals.</p>

<p>"This is our fourth day of isolation,"
announced Sybil, in a tone more irritable than she
was wont to use. "I wonder how long this thing
will last."</p>

<p>"We must be patient," said Orissa, gently.
"Our dear ones are making every effort to find
us, I'm sure, and of course they will succeed in
time. We are at some distance from the usual
route of ships; that is evident; and for this reason
it will be more difficult for our friends to
locate us. I suppose that a few days more may
easily pass by before we catch sight of a boat
coming to get us. But they'll come, Syb," she
repeated, confidently, "and meantime we&mdash;we
must be&mdash;patient."</p>

<p>Sybil stared across the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you play checkers?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Steve and I used to play, long ago. I suppose
I could remember the game, and it might
amuse us; but we have no checkerboard, nor men
for it."</p>

<p>"Pah! and you the sister of an inventor!"
cried Sybil scornfully. "I'm astonished at you,
Miss Kane. Haven't you enough reflected ingenuity
to manufacture a checkerboard?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think so," said Orissa. "The idea
hadn't occurred to me. I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>"You make the board, and I'll find the men,"
proposed Sybil, and springing to her feet she ran
down to the beach, glad to have anything to
occupy her and relieve the dreary dragging of
the hours.</p>

<p>Orissa looked around her, pondering the problem.
Material for a checkerboard seemed hopelessly
lacking, yet after a little thought she solved
the problem fairly well. First she ripped the
flounce from her black silk petticoat and with the
jackknife from the tool kit she cut out thirty-two
black squares, each two inches in diameter. Then
she took a tube of prepared glue that was in the
outfit and walked up the incline to their tent, in
the center of which stood the aluminum chest.
This chest, being of a dull silvery color, and quite
smooth on all its sides, was to be the groundwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the checkerboard squares, as well as the board
itself and the elevated table to play on. Orissa
glued the squares of black silk to the cover of
the chest, leaving a similar square space on the
aluminum surface between each one. When this
was accomplished she pasted a narrow edge of
black around the entire sixty-four squares, thus
marking their boundary.</p>

<p>She was very proud of this work and was
regarding it admiringly when Sybil entered.</p>

<p>"How clever!" cried her chum, genuinely
enthusiastic. "Really, Miss Columbus, you have
done better than I. But here are the checker-men,
and they'll do very nicely."</p>

<p>As she spoke she dumped from her handkerchief
upon the board twenty-four shells which
she had carefully selected from those that littered
the beach. Twelve were dark in color and twelve
pearly white and being of uniform size they made
very practical checkers.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said she, squatting beside the
chest and arranging her shells in order, "I'll play
you a series of games for a box of bonbons, to be
purchased when we return to civilization."</p>

<p>"How many games?" asked Orissa, seating
herself opposite.</p>

<p>"Let us say&mdash;the best three in five. If that's
too rapid we will make the next bet the best six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in ten, or twelve in twenty. Agreeable, Columbus?"</p>

<p>"Entirely so, Crusoe."</p>

<p>It was really a capital diversion. Sybil played
very well and it required all Orissa's cleverness to
oppose her. At times they tired of the play and
went for a stroll on the bluff; and always, no
matter how intent they were upon the game, they
kept watchful eyes on the ocean.</p>

<p>And in this manner the days dragged on their
weary lengths and the nights resounded to the
shrill cries of the owls. One morning Sybil asked:</p>

<p>"Isn't to-day Tuesday, Orissa?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the quiet reply. "We've inhabited
this wilderness just a week."</p>

<small>THE QUEST OF THE SALVADOR</small></h2>


<p>On the roomy forward deck of the <i>Salvador</i> an
earnest conference was held.</p>

<p>"How fast are we going?" asked Steve.</p>

<p>"The captain says about fifteen miles an hour.
That's our best clip, it seems," replied Madeline.</p>

<p>"And very good speed," added Captain Krell,
proudly.</p>

<p>"So it is, for an English yacht," agreed Mr.
Cumberford.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Steve, "we are moving
one-third as fast as the Aircraft did, and we were
about two hours later in starting. Provided the
girls exhaust their gasoline in flying, they will
make a hundred and fifty to two hundred miles,
requiring five or six hours' time. Then they will
alight, bobbing upon the water and helpless to
move in any direction except where the current
carries them. It will take us eighteen hours to
reach that same spot, and we will therefore be
twelve hours behind them. Do you all follow
me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>They nodded, listening intently.</p>

<p>"Now, the girls left at about one thirty this
afternoon. If my calculations are correct, they'll
take to the water anywhere from six thirty to
seven thirty this evening. We shall overtake
them at about the same hour to-morrow morning.
Unless they drift considerably out of their course
we shall see the white planes at daybreak and
have no trouble in running alongside. But there's
always the chance that through some cause they
may manage to drop to water sooner, and perhaps
run the boat toward home. Orissa is a very clever
girl, as you all know; calm and resourceful;
quick-witted and brave. She will do all that anyone
could do to bring the Aircraft under control.
So the one danger, it appears to me, is that we
may pass them during the night."</p>

<p>"That danger, sir," said Captain Krell, "may
be reduced to a minimum. We carry a very
powerful searchlight, which shall be worked by
my men all night, illuminating not only the course
ahead, but the sea for miles on every side. As
you say, Mr. Kane, the white planes may be
easily seen against the blue water, and we positively
cannot miss them during the night."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;interest me," said Mr. Cumberford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>looking more cheerful. "We seem to have everything
in our favor, thanks to Miss Dentry's
generosity."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> glad I bought this yacht!" exclaimed
Madeline, fervently, "for it enabled me to go to
the assistance of those poor girls. I'm sure it
was all providential."</p>

<p>"Let us hope," said Mr. Tupper pompously,
"the young women will survive until we reach
them. However, we shall learn their fate, in any
event, which will afford us a certain degree of
satisfaction."</p>

<p>That speech was like a douche of cold water, but
although the gentleman received various indignant
and reproachful looks he had "sized up the
situation" with fair accuracy.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford, however, since those first
despairing moments on the aviation field, had
recovered command of his feelings and seemed
hopeful, if not confident, of his daughter's ultimate
escape from serious mishap. He was exceedingly
fond of Orissa, too, and even had not Sybil
been with her it is certain that he would have been
much worried and eager to go to her assistance.</p>

<p>Stephen Kane, on the contrary, grew more
nervous as time passed. Better than the others
he knew the dangers that threatened the girls if,
as he suspected, the steering gear had broken and
the elevator and engine control been rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
useless. He racked his brain to think what could
have caused the trouble, but never a hint of the
truth dawned upon him.</p>

<p>The third member of the Kane-Cumberford
party, Mr. H. Chesterton Radley-Todd, had maintained
a discreet silence ever since Miss Dentry
had invited him to join the rescue party. This
she had been led to do by the look of abject misery
on the boy's face, and he had merely pressed her
hand to indicate his thanks. Chesty Todd was
never much of a conversationalist and his appreciation
of his own awkwardness rendered him
diffident unless occasion demanded prompt and
aggressive action, when he usually came to the
front in an efficient if unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Madeline Dentry, seeing Chesty Todd merely
as he appeared, wondered in a casual way why
such a blundering, incompetent booby had been
employed by the Kane-Cumberford firm, but as
the big boy was a part of the "camp" and was
so evidently disturbed by the accident, she was
glad to relieve him to the extent of adding him
to the party.</p>

<p>Very soon after the <i>Salvador</i> started, however,
nearly every one on board began to feel the presence
of the youthful press agent. It was Chesty
Todd who discovered the searchlight aboard and
long before the conference on the deck he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
primed the captain to use it during the coming
night. It was Chesty Todd who sat on a coal-bunker
in the hold, swinging his long legs and
inspiring the engineer, by dark insinuations concerning
the <i>Salvador's</i> ability to speed, to give
her engines every pound of steam she could carry.
It was Chesty who pumped the steward to learn
how well the boat was provisioned and supplied
the deck hands with choice cigars until they were
ready to swear he was a trump and imagined him
quite the most important personage aboard, after
Miss Dentry.</p>

<p>The chef served an excellent dinner in the
cabin, to which no one did full justice except Mr.
Tupper. All were loth to leave the deck long
enough to eat, although they knew a watch was
stationed in the "crow's nest" with powerful
glasses. When night fell the searchlight came
into play and the entire party sat huddled forward,
eagerly following the sweep of light across
the waters. It was ten o'clock when Mr. and Mrs.
Tupper retired, and midnight when Madeline went
to her room, leaving orders to call her if the
Aircraft was sighted.</p>

<p>Stephen Kane, Mr. Cumberford and Chesty
Todd sat by the rail all night, wide-eyed and alert.
Once the searchlight caught the sails of a ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>and they all leaped up, thinking it was the Aircraft.
Again, something dark&mdash;a tangled mass of
wreckage&mdash;swept by them and set their hearts
throbbing until they held the light steadily upon
it and discovered it to be a jumble of kelp and
driftwood. Daylight came and found them wan
but still wakeful, for now they were getting close
to the limit of flight possible to the Aircraft.</p>

<p>Captain Krell was a skillful navigator and,
having taken his course in a direct line from Sealskin
Island, following the flight of Orissa's Hydro-Aircraft,
had not swerved a hair's breadth from
it the entire voyage.</p>

<p>"You see," said Steve, peering ahead in the
strengthening daylight, "the <i>Salvador</i> hasn't
dodged a bit, and the Aircraft couldn't. So we're
bound to strike our quarry soon."</p>

<p>"Wind," suggested Chesty.</p>

<p>"Yes; the wind might carry them a little out
of their course, to be sure," admitted Steve; "but
I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;not far enough to escape our
range of vision."</p>

<p>At about seven o'clock, at Chesty Todd's suggestion,
the engines were slowed down somewhat,
that the lookout aloft might have better opportunity
to examine the sea on all sides of the ship.
The yacht still maintained fair speed, however,
and the call to breakfast finding no one willing to
respond, Madeline ordered coffee and rolls served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
on deck, where they could all watch while refreshing
themselves.</p>

<p>"What's your run, Captain?" asked Steve,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Hundred and forty miles, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Go a little slower, please."</p>

<p>The captain rang the bell to slow down. Presently
the <i>Salvador</i> was creeping along at the rate
of ten miles an hour.</p>

<p>"The gasoline," said Steve, "may have carried
them farther than I figured on. It's a new
machine and I haven't had a chance to test the
exact capacity of the tanks."</p>

<p>The moments dragged tediously. Every person
aboard was laboring under tense excitement.</p>

<p>"What's the run, Captain?"</p>

<p>"One fifty-two, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>Nothing was in sight; only an uninterrupted
stretch of blue sea. Hour after hour passed. At
noon the run was two hundred and twenty miles
and the a&euml;roplane had not been sighted. Steve
turned and faced those assembled.</p>

<p>"It's no use going farther in this direction,"
he said, the words trembling on his lips. "I'm
very sure they couldn't have made this distance."</p>

<p>"Evidently their course has been altered by the
wind," added Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gusty, at times, last night," asserted Chesty.</p>

<p>Steve nodded.</p>

<p>"A strong wind might do what the girls
couldn't," said he. "That is, it might alter the
direction of their flight. How did it blow?"</p>

<p>"At four o'clock, from the north; at five fifteen,
from the west; at six, due south," said Chesty.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes. The
engines had been shut down and the boat lay
drifting upon the water.</p>

<p>"I think it will be well to examine the charts,"
suggested Mr. Todd, "and find out where we are."</p>

<p>"I know where we are," said Captain Krell.
"Wait a moment; I'll get the chart, so you may
all study it."</p>

<p>He brought it from his cabin and spread it upon
a folding table on the deck. A penciled line ran
directly from the port of San Diego to a point
south by southwest.</p>

<p>"A few more hours on the same course and we'd
sight the little island of Guadaloup, off the Mexican
coast," explained Captain Krell. "But the
a&euml;roplane couldn't go so far; therefore we must
search on either side the course we've come."</p>

<p>They all bent their heads over the map.</p>

<p>"What are those unmarked dots which are
scattered around?" inquired Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p>"Islands, sir. Mostly bits of rock jutting out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of the sea. They're not important enough to
name, nor do they appear on an ordinary map;
but a seaman's chart indicates them, for unless
we had knowledge of their whereabouts we might
bump into them."</p>

<p>"They're mostly to the south of us, I see,"
remarked Mr. Tupper.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And it's south we must go, I think," said
Steve, looking at Chesty Todd for the youth to
confirm his judgment. "There was no wind to
take them to the west of this course, I believe."</p>

<p>"That's my idea," declared the press agent.
"I would suggest our doubling back and forth,
on the return trip, covering forty or fifty miles
at each leg. Seems like we couldn't miss 'em,
that way."</p>

<p>After much consultation this plan was finally
agreed upon. The captain outlined his course and
followed it, so that during the next four days not
a square yard of ocean escaped their search. But
it was all in vain and at the end of the fourth day,
with the California coast again in sight, there
was scarcely a person aboard who entertained the
slightest hope of finding the missing girls.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />

<small>CAPRICIOUS FATE</small></h2>


<p>A wireless was sent to the shore, reporting the
failure of the <i>Salvador</i> to locate the runaway
a&euml;roplane and asking if any tidings had been
received of Orissa Kane and Sybil Cumberford.</p>

<p>There was no news.</p>

<p>Madeline called her passengers together again
for a further consultation.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" she asked.</p>

<p>Neither Steve nor Mr. Cumberford could well
reply. Miss Dentry had generously placed her
splendid yacht at their disposal and in person had
conducted the search, neglecting no detail that
might contribute to their success. But failure had
resulted and they could not ask her to continue
what appeared to be a hopeless undertaking.
Steve, who had had ample time to consider this
finale, tried to answer her question.</p>

<p>"We are very grateful to you, Miss Dentry,"
he said, "and both Mr. Cumberford and I fully
appreciate the sacrifice you have made in so
promptly trying to rescue our girls. That we face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
failure is no fault of yours, nor of your crew, and
I realize that you have already done all that
humanity or friendship might require. Of course
you understand that we cannot give up until my
sister's fate, and that of Miss Cumberford, is
positively determined. Therefore, as soon as we
reach shore we shall organize another expedition
to continue the quest."</p>

<p>"You are doing me an injustice, sir," returned
the girl gravely. "Whatever my former plans
may have been I am now determined not to abandon
this voyage until we have found your sister
and her companion. I was greatly attracted by
Orissa Kane, and grieve over her sad fate sincerely.
Moreover, I do not like to put my hand
to the plow without completing the furrow. Unless
you believe you can charter a better boat for your
purpose than the <i>Salvador</i>, or can find a crew
more devoted to your interests, I shall order Captain
Krell to turn about and renew the search."</p>

<p>That, of course, settled the matter. The <i>Salvador</i>
put about and returned to a point where
the see-sawing must be renewed and extended to
cover more expanse of ocean.</p>

<p>Chesty Todd, coming to where Madeline stood
beside the rail, looked into her piquant face with
frank admiration.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Dentry," said he, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
you're what I'd call a brick. I knew, of course,
you'd stick it out, but there's no harm in congratulating
a girl on being true blue. I'm awfully
glad you&mdash;you had the grit to tackle it again.
I'll never be myself again until those girls are
found."</p>

<p>She looked up at him reflectively.</p>

<p>"Which of the young ladies are you engaged
to?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Me?" blushing like a schoolboy; "neither
one, if you please. They&mdash;they're only kids, you
know."</p>

<p>"Then which one do you love?"</p>

<p>"Both!" said Chesty Todd, earnestly.
"They're splendid girls, Miss Dentry; <i>your</i> sort,
you know."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Then it's the 'sort' you love?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you'll allow me. Not the individual&mdash;as
yet. When I love the individual I hope it'll
be the right sort, but I'm so humbly unlucky I'll
probably make a mistake."</p>

<p>For the first time since their acquaintance
Madeline found the big boy interesting. She
knew very little of the history of the Kanes and
Cumberfords, but found Chesty eager to speak of
them and of his past relations with them, being
loud in his praise for the entire "combination."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Cumberford was an eccentric fellow, according to
Mr. Radley-Todd, but "straight as a die." Steve
was chock full of ability and talent, but not very
practical in business ways. Mrs. Kane, Orissa's
blind mother, was the sweetest and gentlest lady
in the world, Sybil Cumberford a delightful mystery
that defied fathoming but constantly allured
one to the attempt, while Orissa&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Orissa Kane is a girl you'll have to read yourself,
Miss Dentry, and the more you study her the
better you'll love her. She's girl all over, and the
kind of girl one always hopes to meet but seldom
does. Old-fashioned in her gentleness, simplicity,
truth and candor; up-to-the-minute in the world's
latest discovery&mdash;the art of flying. Modest as
Tennyson's dairymaid; brave as a trooper; a maid
with a true maid's heart and a thorough sport
when you give her an a&euml;roplane to manage.
Excuse me. I don't often talk this way; usually
I can only express myself in writing. But a fellow
who wouldn't enthuse over Orissa Kane could
only have one excuse&mdash;total dumbness."</p>

<p>"I see," said Madeline, slyly. "Miss Kane is
the type of the 'sort' of girl you love."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But tell me, since you've started on
such an indefinite cruise, is the <i>Salvador</i> well
provisioned?"</p>

<p>"From the sublime to the ridiculous! We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
stores to last our party six weeks, without
scrimping."</p>

<p>"Good. And coal?"</p>

<p>"Enough for a month's continuous run. I had
intended a trip to Honolulu&mdash;perhaps as far as
Japan&mdash;and had prepared for it even before I
was privileged to lay eyes on my yacht."</p>

<p>"How fortunate that was, for all of us! Somehow,
I've a feeling we shall find those girls, this
time. Before, I had a sort of hunch we were
destined to fail. Can you explain that?"</p>

<p>"I shall not try."</p>

<p>"We didn't allow enough for the wind. A sudden
gust might have whirled the Aircraft in any
direction, and it would jog along on that route
until the next blow."</p>

<p>"Do you believe they are still alive?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've never been able to think of them as&mdash;as&mdash;otherwise.
They are wonderfully clever
girls, and Orissa knows a&euml;roplanes backwards
and forwards. She's as much at home in the air
as a bird; and why shouldn't the machine fall
gently to the water, when the gasoline gave out?
If it did, they can float any length of time, and
the Pacific has been like a mill pond ever since
they started. According to Mr. Cumberford, they
have enough food with them to last for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
days. I've an idea we shall run across them
bobbing up and down on the water, as happy and
contented as two babes in the wood." The big
fellow sighed as he said this, and Madeline understood
he was trying to encourage himself, as well
as her.</p>

<p>In spite of Chesty Todd's prediction, day followed
day in weary search and the lost a&euml;roplane
was not sighted. Captain and crew had now abandoned
hope and performed their duties in a perfunctory
way. Stephen Kane had grown thin
and pale and deep lines of grief marked his boyish
face. Mr. Cumberford was silent and stern.
He paced the deck constantly but avoided conversation
with Steve. Madeline, however, kept up
bravely, and so did Chesty Todd. They were
much together, these trying days, and did much
to cheer one another's spirits. Had a vote been
taken, on that tenth dreary day, none but these
two would have declared in favor of prolonging
what now appeared to be a hopeless quest.</p>

<p>"You see," said Chesty to Madeline, yet loud
enough to be heard by both Cumberford and Steve,
"there's every chance of the girls having drifted
to some island, where of course they'd find food
in plenty; or they may have been picked up by
some ship on a long voyage, and we'll hear of 'em
from some foreign port. There are lots of ways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
even on this trackless waste, of their being
rescued."</p>

<p>This suggestion was made to counteract the
grim certainty that the castaways had by now
succumbed to starvation, if they still remained
afloat. Several small islands had already been
encountered and closely scanned, with the idea
that the girls might have sought refuge on one
of them. The main thing that kept alive the
spark of hope was the fact that no vestige of the
Aircraft had been seen. It would float indefinitely,
whether wrecked or not, for the boat had
enough air-tight compartments to sustain it even
in a high sea.</p>

<p>On the evening of this tenth day the <i>Salvador</i>
experienced the first rough weather of the trip.
The day had been sultry and oppressive and
toward sundown the sky suddenly darkened and
a stiff breeze caught them. By midnight it was
blowing a hurricane and even the sturdy captain
began to have fears for the safety of the yacht.</p>

<p>There was little danger to the stout craft from
wind or waves, but the sea in this neighborhood
was treacherous and full of those rocky islets so
much dreaded by mariners. Captain Krell studied
his chart constantly and kept a sharp lookout
ahead; but in such a night, on a practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
unknown sea, there was bound to be a certain
degree of peril.</p>

<p>There was as little sleep for the passengers as
for the crew on this eventful night. The women
had been warned not to venture on deck, where
it was dangerous even for the men; but Madeline
Dentry would not stay below. She seemed to
delight in defying the rage of the elements.
Clinging to the arm of Chesty Todd, the huge
bulk of whose six-feet-three stood solid as a monument,
she peered through the night and followed
the glare of the searchlight, now doubly useful,
for it showed the pilot a clear sea ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper bumped into them, embraced Chesty
for support and then bounded to the rail, to
which he clung desperately.</p>

<p>"Why are you on deck?" asked Madeline,
sternly. "Go below at once!"</p>

<p>Just then a roll of the yacht slid him across the
deck, tumbled him against the poop and then carried
him sprawling into the scuppers. When he
recovered his breath Mr. Tupper crawled cautiously
to the companionway and disappeared into
the cabin.</p>

<p>Steve and Mr. Cumberford had lashed themselves
to the rail and in spite of the drenching
spray continued to peer into the wild night with
fearful intensity. Both were sick at heart, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
they knew if the girls had managed to survive
till now, their tiny boat would be unable to
weather the storm. Every shriek of the wind,
which often resembled a human cry, set them
shivering with terror.</p>

<p>It was toward morning when the glare of the
searchlight suddenly revealed a dark peak just
ahead. Stephen Kane and Mr. Cumberford saw
it, even as the warning scream of the lookout rang
in their ears. Captain Krell saw it, and marveling
at its nearness, sprang to the wheel. Madeline
and Chesty saw it, too, and instinctively the
big fellow put his arms around her as if to
shield her.</p>

<p>Wild cries resounded from the deck; the bells
rang frantically; the engines stopped short and
then reversed just as a huge wave came from
behind, caught the <i>Salvador</i> on its crest and
swept her forward in its onward rush. Two men
threw their weight upon the wheel without effect:
the propeller was raised by the wave above the
water line and whirred and raced madly in the
air, while beneath the gleam of the searchlight a
monstrous mass of rock seemed swiftly advancing
to meet the fated ship.</p>

<p>Past the port side, where Madeline and her
escort clung, swept a jagged point of rock; the
yacht bumped with a force that sent everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
aboard reeling forward in a struggling heap;
then it trembled, moaned despairingly and lay
still, while the wave that had carried it to its
doom flooded the decks with tons of water and
receded to gloat over the mischief it had caused.</p>

<p>The searchlight was out; blackness surrounded
the bruised and bewildered men and women who
struggled to regain their feet, while in their ears
echoed a chorus of terrifying shrieks not of the
wind, but so evidently emanating from living
creatures that they added materially to the panic
of the moment.</p>

<p>Chesty Todd released Madeline, gasping and
half drowned, from the tangle of humanity in the
bow, and succeeded in getting her to the rail. The
bow of the yacht was high and it lay over on one
side, so that the deck was at a difficult angle.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are we sinking?" asked the girl, confused
and unnerved by the calamity.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied Chesty, his mouth to her
ear. "We can't sink, now, for we're on solid
ground and lying as still as a stuffed giraffe."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do?" she cried, wringing
her hands. "If we are wrecked we can't save
Orissa&mdash;perhaps we can't save ourselves! Oh,
what shall we do?&mdash;what shall we do?"</p>

<p>The boy saw that the shock had destroyed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
usual poise and he could feel her trembling as she
clung to him.</p>

<p>"My advice," he said quietly, "is that we all
get to bed and have a wink of sleep. It has been
a long and exciting day for us, hasn't it?"</p>

<small>ON THE BLUFF</small></h2>


<p>Sybil clapped her hands gleefully and looked
at Orissa in triumph.</p>

<p>"The rubber is mine!" she cried. "You now
owe me sixteen boxes of chocolates, nine of caramels
and twelve of mixed bonbons&mdash;enough to
stock a candy store. Tell you what I'll do, Commodore
Columbus; I'll pit my desert island and
my man Friday against your fleet of galleys and
the favor of Queen Isabella, and it shall be the
best three out of five games. Are <i>you</i> game, my
dear Discoverer?"</p>

<p>Orissa laughed.</p>

<p>"You ought to give me odds, Crusoe, for you
are the more skillful checker player," she replied.
"But I won't play any more to-day. This heat
is dreadfully oppressive and from the looks of the
sky I'm afraid a storm is brewing."</p>

<p>"What? A rain storm?" asked Sybil, jumping
up to go outside the tent and examine the sky.</p>

<p>"Rain, hail, thunder, lightning and tornadoes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>anything is likely to follow a storm in this latitude,"
declared Orissa, following her. "I think,
Sybil, we ought to make all as safe and secure as
possible, in case of emergency, while we have the
time."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked Sybil. "I won't
mind the storm very much, if it doesn't have lightning.
That's the only thing I'm afraid of."</p>

<p>Orissa examined the sky critically.</p>

<p>"I predict high winds," she presently said,
"and high winds might endanger our property.
Let us get to the beach, first, and see what may
be done to protect the Aircraft."</p>

<p>They found the flying-machine fairly well protected
by the walls of the ravine in which it lay,
but as the big upper plane offered a tempting
surface to the wind Orissa set to work and
removed it, a task that consumed two full hours.
Then she wired the framework to a big rock, for
additional security, and carrying the canvas from
the plane between them, the girls returned to their
tent.</p>

<p>"Will our house stand much of a wind?" asked
Sybil.</p>

<p>"It is rather exposed, on this bluff," replied
Orissa, doubtfully. "I think it will be wise for
us to pile more rocks upon the edges. The wire
will hold, I'm sure, for it is nickel-steel, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
we close the ends of the tents securely we may
escape damage."</p>

<p>"All right; I'm glad to have something to do,"
cried Sybil, picking up a rock. "We'll build a
regular parapet, if you say so."</p>

<p>This was exactly what they did. In spite of
the oppressive heat the two girls worked faithfully
piling the rocks around the tent, until they
had raised a parapet nearly half its height.
They were inspired to take this precaution by the
glowering aspect of the sky, which grew more
threatening as the afternoon waned.</p>

<p>Finally Orissa wiped the perspiration from her
brow and exclaimed: "That'll do, I'm sure, Syb.
And now I'm ready for dinner. What's to eat?"</p>

<p>Sybil made a grimace.</p>

<p>"Bananas and jelly," she replied. "Could you
conceive a more horrible combination?"</p>

<p>"Meat all gone?"</p>

<p>"We've part of a baked crab; that's all."</p>

<p>"And the lettuce. I shall have crab salad, with
bananas for dessert."</p>

<p>"A salad without lemon or vinegar is the limit,"
declared Sybil. "I shall stick to bananas and
jelly."</p>

<p>Their appetites were still good and Orissa
really enjoyed her salad, which she seasoned with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>salt which they had obtained by evaporating seawater.
The bananas were getting to be a trifle
irksome to the palate, but as food they were
nourishing and satisfying. Neither of the castaways
grumbled much at the lack of ordinary
food, being grateful at heart that they were able
to escape starvation.</p>

<p>The storm burst upon them just after dark and
its violence increased hour by hour. There was
little rain, and no lightning at all, but the wind
held high revel and fluttered the canvas of the
tent so powerfully that the girls, huddled
anxiously in bed, feared the frail shelter would
be torn to shreds.</p>

<p>But the plane-cloth used by Stephen Kane was
wonderfully strong and had been sized with a
composition that prevented the wind from penetrating
it. Therefore it resisted the gale nobly,
and after a time the fears of the two girls subsided
to such a degree that they dozed at times
and toward morning, when the wind subsided,
sank into deep sleep. The hooting of the owls
no longer had power to keep them awake, and on
this night the owls were less in evidence than
usual, perhaps deterred from leaving their nests
by the storm.</p>

<p>Weather changes are abrupt in the semi-tropics.
The morning dawned cool and delightful and the
sun shone brilliantly. There was a slight breeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
remaining, but not more than enough to flutter
Orissa's locks as she unfastened the flap of the
tent and walked out upon the bluff to discover if
the Aircraft was still safe.</p>

<p>It lay at the bottom of the ravine, in plain
sight from where she stood, and seemed quite
undisturbed. Orissa turned her eyes toward the
distant island, let them sweep the tumbling waves
of the ocean and finally allowed them to rest upon
the bay at the east, where they had first landed.
Then she uttered an involuntary cry that echoed
shrilly among the crags.</p>

<p>A ship lay stranded upon the shelving beach&mdash;fully
half its length upon dry land!</p>

<p>The cry aroused Sybil, who came running from
the tent rubbing her eyes and with an anxious
face.</p>

<p>"What's up, Ris?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Orissa pointed a trembling finger across the
rock-strewn plain to the bay, and Sybil looked
and gave a gasp of delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Orissa, we're saved&mdash;we're saved!" she
murmured. Then, sinking upon the sand, she
covered her face with her hands and began to cry.</p>

<p>But the air-maid was too interested to weep;
she was looking hard at the boat.</p>

<p>"Isn't it Madeline Dentry's yacht?" she asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>"Yes; I'm sure it is. Then they've been searching
for us and the storm has wrecked them. Sybil,
your father and Steve may be on that ship, alive
or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sybil sprang up.</p>

<p>"Do you see anyone?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; it's too far away, and the sun interferes.
I'll get the glasses."</p>

<p>She was quite composed now and her quiet
demeanor did much to restore Sybil's self-possession.
Orissa brought the binoculars, looked
through them for a time and then handed the
glasses to her chum.</p>

<p>"Not a soul in sight, that I can see," she
remarked. "Try it yourself."</p>

<p>Sybil had no better luck.</p>

<p>"Can they all be drowned?" she inquired in
horrified tones.</p>

<p>"I think not. They may have abandoned the
wreck, during the storm, or they may be hidden
from us by the side of the boat, which lies keeled
over in the opposite direction from us."</p>

<p>"Can't we go there, Orissa, and find out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; at once. The tide is out, and
although there is quite a sea left from last night's
hurricane I think we can manage the trip, by way
of the sands, with perfect safety."</p>

<p>Each tore a couple of bananas from the bunch
and then they ran down the incline to the beach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Knowing every turn in the coast and every difficult
place, they were able to scorn the waves that
occasionally swept over their feet, as if longing
to draw them into their moist embraces.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<small>BOAT AHOY!</small></h2>


<p>The first indication of dawn found anxious faces
peering over the side of the <i>Salvador</i>. Passengers
and crew gathered at the lower angle and
inspected the position of the boat with absolute
amazement.</p>

<p>"Never, in all my experience," said Captain
Krell, "have I heard of so remarkable a wreck.
We struck the only channel that would have
floated us; a few yards to either side and we
would have been crushed to kindling wood. As
it is, we lie high and dry on this shelf&mdash;a natural
dry dock&mdash;and not a timber is cracked."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" asked Madeline.</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Miss Dentry. We have made a
thorough investigation. But I do not wish to
create any false hopes. Our condition is nearly
as desperate as if we were a total wreck."</p>

<p>"You mean we can't get the yacht off again?"</p>

<p>"I fear not. Even a duplicate of that gigantic
wave which hurled us here would be unable to
float us off, for our tremendous headway carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
us beyond the reach of any tide. This island is
of rock formation. I know at a glance that a
solid bed of rock is under us. Therefore we
cannot dig a channel to relaunch the <i>Salvador</i>."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we blast a channel?" asked Mr.
Tupper.</p>

<p>The captain merely gave him a reproachful
glance.</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Chesty Todd, seriously.
"We'll have Kane invent a sort of dynamite that
will blast the rocks and won't hurt the ship. Good
idea, Mr. Tupper. Clever, sir; very clever."</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper glared at the boy resentfully, but
his wife said in a mild tone of rebuke: "Really,
Martin, my dear, the suggestion was idiotic."</p>

<p>The steward came crawling toward them with
a coffeepot, followed by a man juggling a tray of
cups. It was quite an acrobatic feat to navigate
the incline, but they succeeded and everyone
accepted the coffee gratefully.</p>

<p>"This place is nothing but a rock; an extinct
volcano, probably," remarked Madeline, gazing
thoughtfully over the island.</p>

<p>Chesty, having finished his coffee, climbed to
the elevated side opposite.</p>

<p>"Here's a far better view of the place," he
called. "It's quite a&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
staring fixedly at a white speck far up on the bluff
beside the low mountain.</p>

<p>They waited breathlessly for him to continue.
Then Steve, reading the expression on Chesty's
face, quickly clambered to a place beside him. As
he looked he began to tremble and his face grew
red and then pallid.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cumberford," called the press agent,
"bring your glasses, please."</p>

<p>"What is it?" pleaded Madeline.</p>

<p>"Why, something&mdash;just&mdash;curious, Miss Dentry.
We can't say what it is, as yet, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were all scrambling up the incline by this
time and soon all eyes were directed upon the
white speck. Mr. Cumberford focused his glasses
upon the spot.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he presently; "this interests me;
it does, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Is it a&mdash;a&mdash;tent?" inquired Steve, a catch in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Looks like it," was the reply; "but not a regulation
tent. Seems more like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;Here, see
for yourself, Steve."</p>

<p>Steve seized the binoculars.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;it's&mdash;the&mdash;plane-cloth!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper lost his balance and slid down the
deck, landing with a thud against the opposite
rail. That relieved the tension and a laugh&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
first heard on the <i>Salvador</i> since she left port&mdash;greeted
the gentleman's mishap.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;if it's the plane-cloth, the girls are
alive!" cried Madeline.</p>

<p>"To be sure," added Chesty, with joyful intonation,
"and doubtless enjoying their outing."</p>

<p>The discovery changed the current of all
thoughts and led them to forget their own calamity.
The <i>Salvador</i> carried a small gasoline launch
and two life-boats, all of which were in good condition.</p>

<p>"May we take the launch, Miss Dentry?"
pleaded Steve.</p>

<p>"I was about to order it lowered," she said.
"Can you run it, Mr. Kane?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go with you. It will carry six
comfortably, and more uncomfortably; but as we
may have passengers on our return trip only four
had better go."</p>

<p>Steve ran to assist in lowering the launch. It
had to be unlashed from its rack, first of all, and
the tank filled with gasoline, the engine oiled and
the boat prepared for action. The men worked
with a will, however, and within half an hour the
launch was lowered to the rocks and slid safely
into the water. The landing-steps being impracticable,
a rope ladder was lowered and by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
means Madeline easily descended to the launch.
Mr. Cumberford followed, as a matter of course,
but Chesty Todd modestly waited to be invited to
make the fourth voyager.</p>

<p>"Come along, sir," said Miss Dentry, and he
eagerly obeyed.</p>

<p>"How about food?" he suggested.</p>

<p>The chef, a fat little Frenchman who was much
interested in the fate of the Flying Girl and her
chum, had foreseen this demand and now lowered
a hamper.</p>

<p>"Any water in it?" asked Chesty.</p>

<p>"Certainmente, monsieur."</p>

<p>"All right. Let 'er go."</p>

<p>Steve started the engine and the little craft
quickly shot out of the bay into the open sea and
took the long swells beautifully. Bounding the
point, Kane kept as close to the shore as he dared,
making for the place where the bluff began to rise.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" cried a clear voice, so suddenly
that they nearly capsized the launch in their first
surprise. And there were the two lost damsels
prancing and dancing up and down the beach,
waving their handkerchiefs and laughing and
crying with joy at beholding their friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<small>AN ISLAND KINGDOM</small></h2>


<p>It was a merry reunion, in spite of the dangers
that were past and the tribulations that threatened.
Because the yacht's deck afforded precarious
footing they all landed on the flat rocky
shore, where the breakfast, hastily prepared by
the chef, was served to the united company.</p>

<p>"My greatest suffering," said Sybil, nestling
close to her father, "was for want of coffee. I've
dreamed of coffee night after night, and hoped
I would be privileged to taste it again before I
was called to the happy hunting grounds."</p>

<p>"Ah; that interests me; it does, really," said
Mr. Cumberford, filling her cup anew. "But&mdash;who
knows, dear?&mdash;you might have reached the
happy coffee-grounds."</p>

<p>They laughed at any absurd remark just now,
and when Orissa related how they had subsisted
of late on bananas and jelly you may be sure the
castaways were plied with all the delicacies the
ship's larder afforded.</p>

<p>Most of the day was spent in exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
stories of the adventures both parties had
encountered since the Hydro-Aircraft ran away.
Everyone wanted to add an incident or tell some
personal experience, and it was all so interesting
that no one was denied the privilege of talking.</p>

<p>But afterward, when an elaborate dinner was
served in the cabin&mdash;the table having been
propped level to hold the plates&mdash;they began to
canvass the future and to speculate upon the
possibility of getting to civilization again.</p>

<p>"Our situation is far from hopeless," remarked
Steve, who was now bright and cheery as of old.
"We have the launch and the life-boats, and Orissa
says the Aircraft is in fine condition again. All
the trouble was caused by that unlucky aluminum
chest&mdash;and the fact that my steering gear was too
frail."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call the aluminum chest unlucky,"
said Sybil. "Without it we should have suffered
many privations, for it carried our blankets and
provisions as well as our tools."</p>

<p>"But it was unfortunate that you didn't bolt
it securely," added Orissa.</p>

<p>"Could we venture some two hundred and
eighty miles in open boats?" inquired Madeline.</p>

<p>"We could if obliged to," asserted young Kane.
"Of course, after we got into the track of coastwise
ships, we might be picked up. But I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>like to abandon this beautiful yacht, which must
be worth a fortune and is not damaged to any
extent. I believe the best plan will be for me to
fly home in my machine and secure a boat to come
here and pull the yacht off the beach. There is
a whole barrel of gasoline aboard, intended to
supply the launch, so there is no longer any lack
of fuel for our Aircraft."</p>

<p>They canvassed this plan very seriously and to
all it seemed an excellent idea. But the engineer,
an Irishman named O'Reilly, respectfully suggested
the possibility of getting the yacht launched
by means of a tackle, using her own engines for
power.</p>

<p>Steve caught at this idea and said they would
try it the following morning.</p>

<p>Everyone retired early, for one and all were
exhausted by the trying experiences they had
passed through. The girls, however, warned
them that the owls would interfere seriously with
their sleep. It was not an easy matter to rest,
even in the comfortable berths, on account of the
slanting position of the ship. Those berths on
the right side tipped downward and the mattresses
had to be bolstered up on the edges to
prevent the occupants from rolling out. On the
opposite side the sleeper was pushed to the wall
and the mattress had to be padded in the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
where the wall and bunk met. But they managed
it, after a fashion, and Sybil and Orissa, at least,
slept soundly and peacefully, the luxury of a
bed being so great a relief from their former
inconvenient rock "altar."</p>

<p>The hoots of the owls proved very distracting
to the newcomers, and Mrs. Tupper declared she
would go mad, or die painfully, if obliged to
endure such a screeching for many nights. Even
the crew grumbled and there were many tired eyes
next morning.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over they set to work
to right the yacht, Steve overseeing the work
because of his mechanical experience. A pulley
was attached, by means of a chain, to a peak of
rock on the point opposite the high side of the
yacht, and then a strong cable was run through
the pulley, one end being fastened to the mainmast
and the other to the anchor-windlass, which
was operated by the engine. The stoker got up
steam and then O'Reilly started the engines very
slowly. Lying as it did on a shelf of solid rock,
which had been washed smooth by centuries of
waves, there was only the resistance of the yacht's
weight to overcome; and, although it required all
the power the cable would stand, the boat gradually
came upright until it stood upon a level keel.
Then the men braced it securely with rocks, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
either side the bow, to hold it in position, after
which Steve declared that part of the task had
been accomplished to his entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was indeed a relief to all on board to be able
to tread a level deck again, for, although there
still remained a decided slant from bow to stern
it did not materially interfere with walking, as
had the sharp side slant.</p>

<p>The next task was to arrange the tackle so that
the engines would pull the yacht off the beach into
deep water. But in spite of every effort this plan
failed entirely. The boat would not budge an
inch and after breaking the wire cable again
and again, until it was practically useless, the
undertaking had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>"It's up to the airship to rescue the party, I
guess," sighed Steve, as they sat at dinner after
the energetic and discouraging day's work was
over.</p>

<p>"Do you know, there's a big island just west of
here," said Orissa, thoughtfully. "Through our
glasses we could see that it is green and fertile,
and I've an idea it is inhabited. Wouldn't it be
a good idea to run the launch over there before
Steve undertakes his journey, and see if we can't
secure help to get the yacht off the beach?"</p>

<p>They all became interested in the proposition
at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far is the island?" asked Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p>"Only a few miles; perhaps an hour's run in
the launch."</p>

<p>"Then let us try it, by all means," proposed the
captain.</p>

<p>"We will run over there the first thing in the
morning, with Miss Dentry's consent," decided
Steve.</p>

<p>Madeline heartily agreed and as the sea was
enticingly calm the next morning a party was
made up to visit the larger island in the launch.</p>

<p>At first Captain Krell suggested he should go
with part of his crew, saying that no one could
tell what sort of people might inhabit the island,
if indeed any inhabitants were to be found there;
but Steve scorned the notion of danger.</p>

<p>"We are too near the American coast to run
against cannibals or hostile tribes," he argued;
"and, in any event, our mission is a decidedly
peaceful one. I'll take my revolver, of course,
but it won't be needed. What do you say, Mr.
Cumberford?"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," replied that gentleman.
"I'm going along, if only for the ride."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Madeline.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear!" began Mr. Tupper; but she
silenced him with a single look.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>"That means I must go as chaperon," sighed
Mrs. Tupper.</p>

<p>"I'll be chaperon," laughed Sybil; "but as we
shall go and return in a couple of hours I don't
believe Madeline will really need one."</p>

<p>"You shall stay comfortably on the yacht, Aunt
Anna," said Madeline. "Who else wants to go?
We can carry six, you know."</p>

<p>It was soon arranged to add Mr. Radley-Todd
and Orissa to the four, thus completing the
complement of the launch.</p>

<p>Just before they set off Monsieur Rissette, the
alert chef, appeared with his hamper of lunch,
for he had an established idea that no one should
depart, even on an hour's journey, without a
proper supply of food. Then, merrily waving
adieus to those on board, the explorers glided out
of the bay into the open sea.</p>

<p>Rounding the north end of their islet they saw
clearly the large island ahead, and Steve headed
the launch directly toward it.</p>

<p>The trip consumed rather more than the hour
Orissa had figured on, but it was a light-hearted,
joyous party, and they beguiled the way with
conversation and laughter.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure," said Madeline, "that I am
enjoying this experience far more than I would
a trip to Hawaii. Think of it! A chase, a rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and a wreck, all included in one adventure. I'm
rather sorry it's about over and we are to return
to civilization."</p>

<p>"Sybil and I have had a glorious time," added
Orissa. "Barring the fact that we were a bit worried
over our fate, those days when we played
Crusoe and Columbus on a forsaken island were
full of interest and excitement. I know now that
I enjoyed it thoroughly."</p>

<p>"I quite envy you that delightful experience,"
asserted Madeline.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Sybil. "The adventure wasn't
all pleasant, by any means. The hoots of those
dreadful birds will ring in my ears for years to
come; the food was far from satisfying and I
piled rocks and tramped and sweated until I was
worn to a frazzle. If we had not invented our
checker set I believe we would have become raving
maniacs by the time you found us."</p>

<p>As they drew near to the island they found it
even more green and beautiful than they had suspected.</p>

<p>"It's queer," said Steve, eyeing the place
thoughtfully, "how very imperfect those seamen's
charts are. The one Captain Krell has indicates
nothing but barren rocks in these seas. Not one is
deemed important enough to name; yet here is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
good-sized island that is really inviting enough to
attract inhabitants."</p>

<p>"And, by Jove, it has 'em!" cried Chesty Todd,
pointing eagerly to a thin streak leading skyward.
"See that smoke? That means human beings, or
I'm a lobster."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Cumberford. "That
interests me; it does, really. Head around to the
right, Steve; that's where we'll find the natives."</p>

<p>Steve obeyed. Skirting the shore of the island
he rounded the northern point and found before
him a peculiar inlet. The shore was rocky and
rather high, but in one place two great pillars of
rock rose some fifty feet in the air, while between
them lay a pretty bay which extended far inland.
They afterward found this was the mouth of a
small river, which broadened into a bay at its
outlet.</p>

<p>As the launch turned into this stretch of water,
moving at reduced speed, their eyes were gladdened
by one of the loveliest natural vistas they
had ever beheld. The slope from the table-land
above to the inlet was covered upon both sides
with palms, flowering shrubs and fruit trees, all of
which showed evidence of care. A quarter of a
mile up the little bay was a little dock to which
were moored several boats. The largest of these
was a sixty-foot launch, which made Madeline's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
little craft look like a baby. Two sailboats and a
trio of rowboats, all rather crude in design, completed
the flotilla. On the end of the dock two
men stood, motionless, as if awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Why, they're not natives at all," exclaimed
Sybil, in a low voice. "They&mdash;they're clothed!"</p>

<p>So they were, but in quite a remarkable fashion.
Their feet were bare, their trousers ragged and
soiled; but they wore blue vests highly embroidered
in yellow silk, with velvet jackets and red
sashes tied around their waists. Add to this outfit,
peaked Panama hats with broad, curling
brims, and a revolver and knife stuck in each sash,
and you will not wonder that our friends viewed
this odd couple with unfeigned amazement.</p>

<p>One was a tall, thin man with but one good eye,
which, however, was black and of piercing character.
His face was sullen and reserved. The
second man was short and fat, with profuse whiskers
of fiery red and a perfectly bald head&mdash;a combination
that gave him the appearance of a stage
comedian. The skin of both was of that peculiar
dingy brown color peculiar to Mexicans and some
Spaniards.</p>

<p>The little one, with hat in hand, was bowing with
exaggerated courtesy; the taller one stood frowning
and immovable.</p>

<p>When Steve steered the launch alongside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
dock a broad roadway came into sight, leading
through the trees to the higher elevation beyond,
where stood a white house of fair size which had
a veranda in front. The architecture was of Spanish
order and in its setting of vines and trees it
looked very picturesque. There were climbing
roses in profusion and gorgeous beds of flowers
could be seen in the foreground.</p>

<p>Despite the appearance of the two men, who
might easily be taken for brigands, the place was
so pretty and peaceful and bore such undoubted
evidences of civilization that the visitors had no
hesitation in landing.</p>

<p>Chesty leaped to the dock first and assisted the
three girls to alight beside him. Mr. Cumberford
followed and Steve tied up to an iron ring in the
dock and also stepped ashore. The tall man had
not moved, so far, except that his one dark eye
roved from one member of the party to another,
but the little fat man continued to bow low as each
one stepped ashore, and they accepted it as a sort
of welcome. Neither had uttered a word, however,
so Mr. Cumberford stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Do you speak English?"</p>

<p>They shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is unfortunate. Can you tell me, then,
the name of this island, and who inhabits it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not, Daddy," cried Sybil. "Try 'em
in Spanish, Steve."</p>

<p>But before Stephen, who could speak a little
Spanish, had time to advance, the men turned
abruptly, beckoned the strangers to follow, and
deliberately walked up the broad pathway toward
the dwelling.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Steve, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Let's follow," said Chesty. "I've an idea
these are hired men, and they're taking us to be
welcomed by their master."</p>

<p>"Interesting, isn't it?" muttered Mr. Cumberford,
but with one accord they moved forward
in the wake of their guides.</p>

<small>DON MIGUEL, DEL BORGITIS</small></h2>


<p>Halfway up the road they noticed on the left a
large clearing, in which stood a group of thatched
huts. Some women and children&mdash;all with dark
skins and poorly dressed&mdash;were lounging around
the doorways. These stood silently as the strangers
passed by. A little farther along three men,
attired in exactly the same manner as the two
who were escorting them, were cultivating a garden
patch. They gave no indication they were
aware of the presence of strangers.</p>

<p>There was something uncanny&mdash;wholly unnatural&mdash;about
the manner of their reception and even
about the place itself, that caused some of them
to harbor forebodings that all was not right. Yet
they had experienced no opposition, so far&mdash;no
unfriendliness whatsoever.</p>

<p>Up to the broad veranda they were led, and this,
now viewed closely, showed signs of considerable
neglect. The house, built of rough boards, needed
whitewashing again; the elaborate stained-glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
windows were thick with dust; the furnishings of
the wide veranda, which were somewhat prodigal,
seemed weather-stained and unkempt. On a small
wicker table was a dirty siphon bottle and some
soiled glasses with bugs and flies crawling over
them. Beside these stood a tray of roughly made
cheroots.</p>

<p>The fat man at once disappeared through the
open doorway of the dwelling, but the tall man
faced the strangers and, spreading out his arms
as if to forbid their entrance, pointed to the
chairs and benches scattered in profusion about
the veranda.</p>

<p>"Invited to sit," interpreted Mr. Cumberford.
"Interesting&mdash;very."</p>

</div>
</div>




<p>Suddenly a huge form filled the doorway, inspecting
the newcomers with a quick, comprehensive
glance. The man was nearly as tall as Chesty
Todd, but not so well built. Instead of being athletic,
he possessed a superabundance of avoirdupois,
evidently the result of high living. He was
clothed all in white flannel, but wore a blue linen
shirt with a soiled collar and a glaring red necktie
in which glittered a big diamond. Jewels were on
his fingers, too, and even on his thumbs, and a gold
chain passed around his neck fell in folds across
his breast and finally ended in his watch-pocket.
On his feet were red slippers and on his head a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>sombrero such as the others had worn. A man of
perhaps thirty-five years of age, rather handsome
with his large eyes and carefully curled mustache,
but so wholly unconventional as to excite wonder
rather than admiration.</p>

<p>He had merely paused in the doorway for that
one rapid glance. Immediately he advanced with
a brisk step, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Welcome, se&ntilde;ors and se&ntilde;oritas&mdash;America&ntilde;os
all&mdash;most joyous welcome. You the Spanish
speak? No! It cannot matter, for I speak the
English. I am so pleasured that my humble home
is now honored by your presence. You make me
glad&mdash;happy&mdash;in rapture. You do not know to
where&mdash;to whom&mdash;you have come? Imagine! I
am Don Miguel del Borgitis, and this"&mdash;extending
his arms with a proud gesture&mdash;"my own Island
of Borgitis&mdash;a kingdom&mdash;of individual property,
however small, for it owes allegiance to no other
nation on earth!"</p>

<p>This was spoken very impressively, while the
shrewd eyes read their faces to determine the
degree of awe created.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, giving them no chance to
reply, "I am really King&mdash;King of Borgitis&mdash;but
with modesty I call myself Don Miguel del Borgitis.
As such I welcome you. As such I take
you to my arms in friendship. Observe, then, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
my kingdom is yours; you shall reign in my place;
you shall command me; for does not Don Miguel
ever place his friends above himself?"</p>

<p>This seemed cordial enough, certainly, but it
was rather embarrassing to find an answer to
such effusiveness. Don Miguel, however, did not
seem to expect an answer. With merely an impressive
pause, as if to drive the words home, he
continued: "May I, then, be honored by a recital
of your names and station?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Mr. Cumberford. "You&mdash;er&mdash;interest
me, Don Miguel; you do, really.
Quite a relief, you see, to find a gentleman, a
civilized gentleman, in these wilds, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My island kingdom is very grand&mdash;very important&mdash;Se&ntilde;or
America&ntilde;o," interrupted Don Miguel,
evidently piqued at the use of the term "wilds."
"In effect have I reign over three islands&mdash;the one
from which you now come, the one to the west of
here, and&mdash;the Grand Island Borgitis! Three
Islands and one owner&mdash;One King&mdash;with privilege
to decree life and death to his devoted subjects.
But you have more to say."</p>

<p>They were a bit startled to hear that he knew
they came from the island of the owls. But they
reflected that some of his people might have
watched the progress of their launch.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford introduced his party to Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Miguel, one by one, afterward briefly relating the
a&euml;rial trip of the two girls, the search for them
by the yacht and the unfortunate beaching of the
<i>Salvador</i> on the island during the recent storm,
ending with the surprising reunion of the party
and their desire to secure help to get the launch
into deep water again, that they might return
home.</p>

<p>To all this Don Miguel listened intently, his
head a little to one side, his eyes turning critically
to each person mentioned during the recital. Then
said he, more soberly than before:</p>

<p>"How unfortunate that your ship is wreck!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not wrecked," returned Madeline.
"It is merely stuck on those rocks&mdash;'beached' is, I
think, the proper word."</p>

<p>"Then, alas! it is wreck."</p>

<p>"It is not injured in the least, sir," declared
Steve.</p>

<p>Don Miguel's face brightened at this statement,
but he controlled his elation and responded sadly:</p>

<p>"But it is no longer a ship, for you cannot get
it off the land."</p>

<p>"Not without your kind assistance, I fear," said
Miss Dentry.</p>

<p>"Make me obliged by resuming your seats,"
requested Don Miguel. Then he clapped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>hands, and the red-bearded man appeared. "Refreshments,
Pietro!" He offered the cheroots to
the men, and when they refused selected one for
himself and lighted it. Then, leaning back in his
arm-chair, he regarded his guests musingly and
said:</p>

<p>"It is laughable. Really, it amuses one! But
under the Spanish Grant by which I hold my
islands&mdash;my kingdom&mdash;I am exclusively owner of
all wrecks on my shores. In fact, were you not
my dear friends, I could take your yacht, which
I now own because it lies wreck on my coast."</p>

<p>"But it is <i>not</i> wrecked!" asserted Steve, frowning,
for he was beginning to suspect Don Miguel.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, since you tell me so; but I will
see. I will see for myself. Ah, the poor refreshments&mdash;the
offering of hospitality to a king's
friends. Partake, is my earnest implore, and
so honor your humble host&mdash;Don Miguel del
Borgitis."</p>

<p>The tall man and the short man brought wines,
liquors and glasses, with a fresh siphon of clear
water. Following them came a sour-faced woman
of middle age and a pretty young girl of perhaps
sixteen years&mdash;pretty in the Spanish fashion, with
plump cheeks, languid dark eyes and raven hair.
These last carried trays of fruits and cake, which
they passed to the company. The woman's face
was expressionless; that of the girl evinced eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
curiosity and interest; but neither spoke nor
seemed to receive the notice of the royal Don
Miguel.</p>

<p>When they had all positively refused to accept
any of the strong drink, the Don helped himself
liberally to a milky liquor diluted with water,
which he called pulque. As he sipped this he said
to them:</p>

<p>"The life here on Borgitis is grand&mdash;magnificent&mdash;entrancing&mdash;as
you will easily conceive. But it
is also lonely. I have here no equals with whom
I may freely associate. So it delights me to receive
you as guests. May you long enjoy my hospitality&mdash;it
is a toast which I drink with fervency."</p>

<p>"We return to the yacht at once," said Steve,
stiffly.</p>

<p>"My mansion is roomy and comforting," continued
the other, as if he had not heard, "and
here are no owls to annoy one. Some day I will
take you to visit the third island of my kingdom.
It is called Chica&mdash;after my daughter, here." He
glanced at the young girl, as he spoke, and she
cast down her eyes, seeming frightened.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford arose.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "we thank you for your hospitality,
which we regret we are unable to further
accept. Let us come to the point of our errand.
We need your assistance and are willing to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
for it&mdash;liberally, if need be. You have plenty of
men here, I observe, and a large launch. Send
a crew with us to our island&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My island, se&ntilde;or, if you please."</p>

<p>"Very well. Send a crew of men to help us,
and come along yourself, if you like. But whatever
you do, kindly do it at once, as we have no
time to waste."</p>

<p>He spoke positively, in a way that required an
answer; but Don Miguel merely took a cake from
the tray, and as he munched it said casually in
Spanish, as if addressing the air: "Prepare my
launch; have the men in readiness; lock the little
boat securely."</p>

<p>Without a glance at his master, the one-eyed
man deliberately left the veranda and walked
down the path. Steve pricked up his ears. He
understood the carefully veiled command, and it
nettled him.</p>

<p>"What little boat do you refer to, sir?" he
pointedly asked.</p>

<p>Don Miguel gave a start, but tossed off the contents
of his glass, and rose.</p>

<p>"I shall prepare to go at once to visit your
yacht, with my own men and in my own launch,"
said he. "You will be good enough to amuse
yourselves here until I send you the word that I
am ready to depart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>With this he lazily stretched his big body,
yawned, and turned his back on his "beloved
guests," to leave the veranda and proceed leisurely
down the path to the inlet.</p>

<small>THE MASK OFF</small></h2>


<p>"Come!" cried Steve, impatiently. "The Don
is either a fool or a rascal, and in either event I
propose to keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Chesty Todd, nodding
approval.</p>

<p>As with one accord they rose and started to
leave the veranda the fat little man with the red
whiskers barred their way, removing his hat to
indulge in his absurd bow.</p>

<p>"My noble master has desire that you remain
his guests," said he in bad English. "Some time
will he send word he is ready for you to depart."</p>

<p>"Out of the way, fellow," said Chesty, pushing
him aside.</p>

<p>"My noble master has desire that you remain
his guests," repeated the man, moodily, and there
was a defiant twinkle in his pig-like eyes that
indicated he had received positive orders to detain
the strangers.</p>

<p>But Mr. Radley-Todd's ire was aroused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand back!" he cried threateningly. "Your
master is not our master."</p>

<p>"Very true, Chesty," said Mr. Cumberford;
and then they all hurried down the path toward the
inlet. They were not three minutes behind Don
Miguel, yet as they reached the dock the big
launch left it, filled with dark-skinned men. In
the stern stood Don Miguel, smoking his cheroot,
and he made them an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>"Have patience, dear guests," said he. "I will
satisfy myself if your boat is wreck or is not
wreck, and soon will I return to consult with you.
Kindly excuse until I have investigation made.
Oblige me to use my island as if it were your
own."</p>

<p>"The rascal!" cried Mr. Cumberford, as
the boat of Don Miguel swept down the inlet.
"Tumble into the launch, girls, quick! I believe
we can get to the yacht before he does."</p>

<p>But the girls hesitated to obey, for Steve and
Chesty Todd were bending over the bow of the
launch, where the rope hawser had been replaced
by a heavy chain, which was fastened by a huge
padlock.</p>

<p>Steve picked up an iron bar, twisted it in the
chain and endeavored to wrench the iron ring
from its socket; but it was firmly embedded in
the dock, being held by a powerful cement. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
he tried breaking away the launch, but the
fastenings held firmly.</p>

<p>"No use, Steve," said Chesty, squatting down
on the dock. "We must have the key. Question
is, who's got it? That pirate, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a pirate, all right," said Sybil, angrily.</p>

<p>"What do you think he intends to do?"
Madeline quietly asked.</p>

<p>"Take the folks on the yacht by surprise, capture
the ship and then claim it is his, because it
is beached upon his island," replied Steve.</p>

<p>"How absurd!" exclaimed Orissa.</p>

<p>"Yes; but the scoundrel knows no law,"
declared Mr. Cumberford. "In this lost and forgotten
island he has played the tyrant with a
high hand; I can see that by the humble subjection
of his people; and so he thinks he can rob
us with impunity."</p>

<p>"He is mistaken, though," asserted Madeline
greatly annoyed. "If this is really an independent
island, I shall send an armed ship here to demand
reparation&mdash;and force it. If the Don lies, and he
is under the domain of any recognized nation, then
our government shall take the matter up."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Mr. Cumberford. "Interesting;
very. Provided, of course, we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Er&mdash;er&mdash;it is really a pretty island, and&mdash;interesting,"
he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Daddy means," said Sybil, "that Don Miguel
has no intention of letting us get back to civilization
again, provided the yacht proves to be worth
taking&mdash;and keeping."</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly," said Chesty; "only Mr.
Cumberford did not like to disturb your equanimity.
But he sized up the situation, as we all
did. Eh, Steve?"</p>

<p>Steve nodded, looking gloomily at the three
girls.</p>

<p>"How many men did he take with him?" asked
Madeline.</p>

<p>"About fifteen. I tried to count 'em," said Mr.
Todd. "But they did not seem to be armed."</p>

<p>"There are seven on the yacht, besides Mr.
Tupper, who doesn't count; and they have no
arms, either, that I know of."</p>

<p>"They won't be expecting to defend themselves,
anyhow," observed Chesty. "Therefore the yacht
is as good as captured."</p>

<p>"And with the noble Don in possession," added
Sybil, "our plans for a homeward voyage are
knocked sky-high."</p>

<p>"The yacht will be a great find for him,"
remarked Mr. Cumberford; "so I imagine he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
condemn it as 'wreck' on his shores and keep it
for himself."</p>

<p>"With certainty, se&ntilde;or," said a soft voice
beside him.</p>

<p>They all turned to find that the Spanish girl
had quietly joined their group. Behind her came
limping the Red-beard, sullen and muttering at his
rebuff. The girl faced Pietro and uttered a sharp
command in Spanish. He hesitated, mumbled a
reply and retreated up the path.</p>

<p>"So you think Don Miguel will keep my
yacht?" asked Madeline, approaching the pretty
child and speaking in a kindly tone.</p>

<p>"I do, se&ntilde;orita. But his name is not Don
Miguel del Borgitis, as he said. He is Ramon
Ganza, a fugitive from Mexico, where he robbed
a bank of much money and escaped. He came
here in his launch with ten men, and has been hiding
for many years in this island, where no people
lived before he came."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Madeline; "a criminal
and a refugee! And you are his daughter?"</p>

<p>"No, se&ntilde;orita. He said so, but he lied. He
lies always, when he speaks. He coaxed me away
from my people in Mazatlan, when he came there
to buy provisions, saying I would become a
princess. But I am merely a housemaid, in truth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"How many years has he lived on this island?"
inquired Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p>"I do not know, se&ntilde;or. But it is many. He
has built the house, yonder, or rather he has
forced his poor men to build it. Ramon loves to
pose as a royal Don, but I do not think he is of
noble birth. Once every year he goes to Mexico
or the United States for supplies, and sometimes
he coaxes others to come back with him, and be
his slaves."</p>

<p>"And do the people love their master?" asked
Madeline.</p>

<p>"No. They hate him, but they fear him. Not
one who has ever come here has gone away again,
for he dares not let them return to tell where he
is hiding. Now there are seventeen men and nine
women here. With you, and those he will fetch
from your yacht, there will be many more; but
none of you will ever leave here with Ramon's
consent," declared the girl.</p>

<p>"Then we will leave without it," remarked Mr.
Todd, easily.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, eager look.</p>

<p>"Will you dare to oppose Ramon, then?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"On occasion we are rather daring," said
Chesty, smiling at her simplicity. "The fellow
ought to be arrested and given up to justice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, if you would do that, we could all
go away!" said the child, clasping her hands
ecstatically. "Please arrest him, sir; I beg you
to."</p>

<p>"We'll see about it, little one. Meantime, how
can we get the key to unlock this chain?"</p>

<p>"Would you follow Ramon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is our greatest ambition, just now."</p>

<p>"Then I'll get you the key. Pietro has it."</p>

<p>"The Red-beard?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Pietro is my friend. He is not so bad
as some of the other men."</p>

<p>"They must be a sorry lot," decided Chesty.
"Come on, then, Chica; I'll help you to interview
Pietro."</p>

<p>The man was sitting on a rock nursing his
grievances.</p>

<p>"The key, Pietro," said Chica.</p>

<p>"No," he answered surlily.</p>

<p>"I want it, Pietro."</p>

<p>"He'll whip me. But then, he'll whip me anyhow,
for not to stop his 'guests.' Take the key,
Chica. Pah! a few lashes. Who care?"</p>

<p>He tossed the key upon the ground at her feet
and Chesty promptly picked it up. The girl looked
hard at Red-beard.</p>

<p>"You will not be whipped," she said softly. "It
is all right, Pietro. The America&ntilde;os will arrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Ramon Ganza and deliver him up to justice; they
have promised it; so you will be safe. Come with
me. Our new friends need guns."</p>

<p>"What!" The man fairly gasped in his
amazement at her temerity.</p>

<p>"Our new friends shall take all they need of
Ramon's store of guns. They are not like the
others who come here; the America&ntilde;os are not
cowards. You will see them conquer Ramon very
nicely, and with no trouble at all. Come, Pietro&mdash;the
guns!"</p>

<p>The man slowly rose and led the way to the
house, while Chesty called for Steve and then
followed.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Chesty and Steve returned to
the dock where the others awaited them, and both
were loaded with rifles, revolvers and ammunition,
ruthlessly abstracted from the private stores
of the island magnate.</p>

<p>When these were distributed, the launch
unlocked and they were ready to start, Madeline
turned to Chica.</p>

<p>"Get in, dear," said she. "I think it will be
best for you to come with us. Provided we ourselves
manage to escape, I promise to take you to
Mazatlan and restore you to your own people."</p>

<p>The child hesitated, looking at the little fat
Red-beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid Pietro will suffer for helping
us," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah; 'tis true," agreed Red-beard. "Unless
you please will arrest Ramon, Ramon will whip
me until I faint. I know; it is his habit when he
is opposed."</p>

<p>"Get aboard, then," said Steve, impatiently.
"There's room enough, and your service may
come handy to us."</p>

<p>Somewhat to their surprise the man came
aboard without an instant's hesitation, and at
once Steve started the engine.</p>

<p>"Are any other men left upon this island?"
asked Mr. Cumberford, as the launch gathered
way and darted down the inlet.</p>

<p>"Two," said Chica. "But they have no orders
to interfere with you, so they will be blind. Fourteen
have gone with Ramon."</p>

<p>"Are they armed?" asked Orissa.</p>

<p>"I do not know, se&ntilde;orita. Francisco may be,
and perhaps Tomas; but Ramon is afraid to trust
many of his men with guns."</p>

<p>Heading out of the inlet they rounded the pillar
of rock and skirted the shore until the open sea
lay between them and Owl Island. Now they were
able to see plainly the big launch of Ramon Ganza
plodding along in advance. It had fully half an
hour's start of them, yet from the distance it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
gone Steve awoke to the fact that it was
not nearly so speedy as Madeline's little boat.
Although the big launch had gasoline engines of
comparatively modern pattern, the lines of the
boat were broad and "tubby," in strong contrast
with the slender, graceful waist of the <i>Salvador's</i>
launch. Moreover, Ramon had neglected his
machinery, as he had everything else on the island,
and the engines did not work as well as they
should.</p>

<p>"I've an idea that I can beat the pirate to the
<i>Salvador</i>," said Steve.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" cried Chesty; "if you could do
that, old man, you'd save the day."</p>

<p>"What difference would it make?" inquired
Madeline.</p>

<p>"Their plan is to take our crew by surprise,
board the yacht and make prisoners of every man
jack&mdash;also of Mrs. Tupper," explained Chesty.
"Then, when we arrive, our capture could be
easily accomplished. But if we manage to get
there first, warning our men and taking them
these weapons, we stand a good chance of beating
off the rascally potentate and holding possession."</p>

<p>"They are not really pirates, I suppose,"
remarked Sybil.</p>

<p>"According to this child's story," declared Mr.
Cumberford, "the man is a fugitive from justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and so has no respect for the rights or property
of anyone. Mexico, his own country, has outlawed
him and doubtless if the authorities could
put their hands on the fellow they'd clap him in
jail and keep him there."</p>

<p>They considered this statement gravely.</p>

<p>"For which reason," remarked Chesty Todd,
"Ramon Ganza is desperate. He can't afford to
let us get away and carry the news of where his
island retreat may be located. Therefore, good
people, this is going to be a lively little scrap, so
let's grit our teeth and do our level best."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />

<small>AN EXCITING RACE</small></h2>


<p>Steve was giving the engine all his attention and
coaxing it to develop all the speed of which it
was capable. Even with eight people aboard&mdash;two
more than its regular complement&mdash;it was
beginning to gain on the big boat ahead. Orissa,
at the steering wheel, was also intent upon her
task.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumberford turned to Chica.</p>

<p>"How did Ramon manage to build that house,
and make such a big settlement on the island, all
in secret?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Pietro knows," said she.</p>

<p>"In Mexico," stated Red-beard, halting at times
in his English, "Ramon rob bank of much money.
Then he escape in boat an' find islan'. He think
it fine place for hide. So he go to Unite' State&mdash;to
San Pedro&mdash;an' buy much thing with his money&mdash;much
lumber&mdash;much food in tin can&mdash;many
thing he will need. He hire ship to take all to
his islan'. It big sail-ship, but it old an' not ver'
good. In San Pedro Ramon find some Mexicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
who do bad things an' so are afraid to go back
to Mexico. He say he make them rich, so they
go with him on ship. I go, too.</p>

<p>"Storm come an' make ship leak, but we get to
islan' an' unload ever'thing. Captain start to go
back, but ship leak so bad he run on rocks at West
Islan'. Ship go wreck an' men drown. By'mby
Ramon go out to wreck, take all thing he want
an' let wreck go. It now on rocks at West Islan'.
No good, now."</p>

<p>This terse recital was listened to with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Interesting&mdash;very," was Mr. Cumberford's
comment, and they all supported his verdict.</p>

<p>"Then Ramon make us build house an' make
garden," continued Red-beard. "When we get
mad an' not mind Ramon, he whip some of us
with his own hand, an' then others scare an' work
hard. Two, three time, Ramon go in launch to
Mexico. He land secret, in night time, and get
more men to come back with him to islan'. Nobody
know him in the places he goes. One time he coax
Chica from her nice home, that way, an' bring her
to islan', to make her help the women work in his
house."</p>

<p>Chica nodded.</p>

<p>"But now I go home," she said, confidently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"When kind America&ntilde;os arrest Ramon, I go
free."</p>

<p>But arresting Ramon was not so much in the
thoughts of the America&ntilde;os just then as the result
of the race to reach the <i>Salvador</i>. Madeline's
launch was gaining steadily, but both boats were
gradually drawing nearer to their destination and
the problem was which could arrive first? Already
the little boat had been seen and its purpose
understood by the wily Mexican. He could not
know how it was that the Americans had managed
to secure their boat and were able to follow him
so soon, but the fact that they were in his wake
and quickly closing the gap between the two
launches was sufficient information for the time
being, and it did not particularly disturb him.</p>

<p>Ramon Ganza reasoned that in order to beat
him to the yacht the little launch must pass near
him, but in doing so he would intercept it and
by grappling it with boat-hooks take it and its
occupants along with him. If the Americans kept
out of range and gave his boat a wide berth, he
would be able, in spite of their superior speed, to
beat them to the yacht by maintaining his course
in a straight line.</p>

<p>This danger was soon appreciated by the pursuers;
for, whenever they altered their course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Ganza altered his, to head them off by getting
directly in their way.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Cumberford, grimly, "this interests
me."</p>

<p>"It interests us all," observed Steve, dryly.
"The big boat is like a rock in our path."</p>

<p>Orissa looked at her brother inquiringly.</p>

<p>"How shall I steer?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We shall have to circle around them, to keep
out of their way. They think that they will beat
us, and they may; but I'm not sure of it&mdash;as yet."</p>

<p>"Is it best to argue the point, Steve?" asked
Chesty.</p>

<p>"I really think our salvation depends on our
getting to the yacht first," was the reply.</p>

<p>For some time after this no one spoke. The
engine, under Steve's skillful handling, was doing
its utmost, with never a skip or protest of any
sort. The man who was running the larger boat
was also crowding his engines, urged thereto by
his domineering master. The sea was ideal for
the race and favored both boats alike.</p>

<p>They continued the dodging tactics some time
longer, the smaller boat being forced to the outside
and unable to cut in ahead.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" cried Steve, much chagrined,
"here's the island, and they've got the inside
track."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but something's wrong with them,"
remarked Mr. Cumberford. "They're slowing
down."</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's a fact!" cried Chesty, elated.</p>

<p>Steve stood up and shaded his eyes with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Their engines have stopped," he said. "That's
a streak of luck I hadn't banked on. Head in,
Orissa. We're all right now, if they don't start
again promptly."</p>

<p>There was evident excitement on board the
larger motor boat. Ramon kicked the new engineer
away and himself took his place. The engine
revolved, made a brief spurt&mdash;and stopped dead.
Ramon made another attempt, while his boat
bobbed placidly up and down on the waves.</p>

<p>Meantime the launch, still keeping to its wide
circle, rounded the point of rock and headed into
the bay, where the <i>Salvador</i> lay with her trim
white sides glistening in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried Steve, as soon as he could be
heard by those at the rail, "let down the ladder.
They're after us!"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" demanded Mr. Tupper, curiously;
but Captain Krell marked the panic on the faces
of those on board the launch and issued prompt
orders. The aft davits were run down in a jiffy
and Steve and Chesty hooked them to the launch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which was quickly raised with all on board and
swung over the rail to the deck.</p>

<p>There were a few tumbles and some scrambling
to get out of the boat, but at that moment Ramon
Ganza's big launch swept into the bay, and the
Mexican, assured by one sharp glance that his
clever plan to surprise the yacht was thwarted,
shut down the engines and halted his craft while
he examined the situation at his leisure.</p>

<p>Madeline Dentry's superb yacht was indeed a
prize worth winning. It was even worth running
some risks to acquire. Ramon reflected that the
<i>Salvador</i> and her helpless crew were really at his
mercy, for they were unable to float the ship and
were at present securely imprisoned. He laughed
rather maliciously at their vain opposition, and
said to his lieutenant, the one-eyed man:</p>

<p>"Very good, Francisco. Everything comes my
way, you see. A little patience and the beautiful
ship is ours, for it surely is wreck, and I justly
claim all wrecks on my islands. There will be
rum aboard, or at least plenty of liquors and
wines. Champagne, perhaps. You shall have all
the spirits for your drink if you back me up firmly
in my demands."</p>

<p>"What will you do, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"Insist on taking possession of the ship, which,
according to my law, is mine," he answered, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
grim humor. "Perhaps they may object, in which
case you will stand by your chief. But understand:
you must use no knives or pistols; I can't
afford to have murder added to the charges
against me. If diplomacy fails, we will fight with
our bare fists, in American fashion, and our numbers
will suffice to conquer those insolent strangers
who come here uninvited and then refuse to
abide by my laws."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a note-book and with a
fountain pen wrote upon one of the leaves as
follows:</p>



<p class="p20">"To my beloved Friends, the America&ntilde;os:</p>

<p>Alas, your ship is hopeless wreck. I, the lord
and ruler of these islands, behold the sad condition
and with grief, for I must condemn the
ship as wreck, which I do by right of Spanish
Grant to me, from which is no appeal. With pain
for your loss, I am obligated to confiscate the ship
that before was yours, with all it contains, and
to declare it is now mine. I demand that you
deliver my property into my hands at once, in the
name of law and justice, and I believe you will do
so, because otherwise you will become the enemies
of the kingdom of</p>

<p class="px">
<span class="smcap">Don Miguel del Borgitis</span>, Rex."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>He tore out this leaf, folded it neatly and then
boldly ran his launch to the side of the yacht.
Francisco stuck the paper on the point of a boat-hook
and standing on a seat thrust the epistle so
far up the side that Captain Krell was able to
lean over and grasp it. Then the launch returned
to its former position, while the captain carried
the note to Madeline.</p>

<p>She read it aloud and their anxiety did not
prevent the Americans from laughing heartily at
the preposterous claim of this audacious Mexican
refugee.</p>

<p>"At the same time," said Miss Dentry, resuming
her gravity, "our case appears to be somewhat
serious. The man has unmasked and shown
us clearly his intentions. He believes we can
expect no succor from outside, and in that he is
quite correct. Only by our own efforts and the
exercise of our wits may we hope to circumvent
his intentions and retain our freedom and our
property."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />

<small>BESIEGED</small></h2>


<p>Disregarding the lordly disposal of the yacht
and its contents so coolly outlined by Se&ntilde;or Ramon
Ganza, those aboard the <i>Salvador</i> began to face
the probability of a siege. They all gathered aft,
where, shielded by the bulwarks from the view
of the Mexicans, they could converse at leisure
and with safety. At Madeline's suggestion, every
member of the crew, seven in number, was present
while the details of their visit to the larger
island were related by his principals. The character
of the lordly islander, and his history as
gleaned from Pietro and Chica, were likewise canvassed,
and his evident intention to add the strangers
to his band of cowed subjects was impressed
upon the entire company in a most
forcible manner.</p>

<p>"It would have been serious, indeed," continued
Madeline, "had Ganza arrived here before us and
found you unwarned and unarmed, for you could
not have resisted his invasion. But his clever
scheme was frustrated by an accident to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
engines of his launch, and now we must bend our
every energy to driving him away and making our
escape from this dreadful island."</p>

<p>"We don't know yet, of course, how that can be
done," added Mr. Radley-Todd, reflectively; "but
there's no hurry about deciding it. We are pretty
well provisioned for a siege, and Steve and
I captured from the enemy and brought with
us nine rifles, half a dozen revolvers, and some
ammunition."</p>

<p>"We have also a small supply of arms and
ammunition in the storeroom of the yacht," said
Captain Krell. "The former owner was something
of a sportsman, and I think you will find the
guns to be shotguns."</p>

<p>"All the better," said Chesty. "These fellows
may decide to board us, in which case the shotguns,
at short range, will scatter their loads and
do fearful execution. Get 'em up, Captain. Let's
have on deck, where it's handy, every offensive
and defensive weapon aboard."</p>

<p>"I don't want any shooting," protested Madeline;
"I'd rather give them the yacht."</p>

<p>"We won't need to shoot," returned Steve.
"A big bluff is all that is necessary."</p>

<p>The entire company now understood the importance
of a successful resistance, and aside from
the fact that Mrs. Tupper had violent hysterics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
which lasted several hours and nearly caused her
devoted husband to jump overboard, the situation
was accepted by all with philosophical composure.
A definite plan to guard the deck and prevent the
foe from scaling the sides was adopted and each
man given his position and instructed what to do.</p>

<p>As they were dealing with a desperate and
unscrupulous man, a self-constituted autocrat in
this practically unknown group of islands, they
realized the wisdom of being constantly alert; so
all the men, passengers and crew alike, were
divided into watches during every hour of day
and night, and those not on duty slept in their
clothing that they might respond instantly to any
call to action.</p>

<p>The Mexican, however, proceeded very deliberately
with the siege, believing his victims were
trapped and unable to escape him. He withdrew
for a time around the rocky point, where he disembarked
ten of his fourteen men. With the other
four he ran the launch to the mouth of the bay
again and dropped anchor, evidently intending to
block any egress by the boats of the yacht.</p>

<p>That night, under cover of the darkness, for the
moon was often obscured by shifting clouds,
Ramon's men deployed among the rocks on both
sides of the narrow channel, where they erected
two miniature forts, or lookouts, by piling up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
loose rocks. Behind each rock barrier some of the
men were stationed, with instructions to watch
every movement on the deck of the <i>Salvador</i> and
report to their master. The Mexicans were well
protected by the rocks from the firearms of those
on board, if the defenders resorted to their use,
and because of the slant of the deck from fore to
aft Ramon could himself command almost the
entire deck as he sat in his launch.</p>

<p>Realizing this disadvantage, Radley-Todd and
O'Reilly, the engineer, crept down to the stern
and by pushing the ends of their rifles through
the hawser-holes were able to bring the launch
under such direct fire that the outlaw decided that
discretion was the better part of valor and withdrew
his boat to a safer anchorage around the
point, where he might still intercept the passage
of any boat that ventured to come out.</p>

<p>The next morning Francisco of the one eye and
a comrade took the launch back to the other island
for a store of provisions. When they returned,
at noon, they brought the two men who had been
left behind when the first expedition set out, and
also one of the rowboats, which was allowed to
trail behind the launch.</p>

<p>With the Americans surrounded and on the
defensive Ramon felt that he could safely remove
his entire force from his home island and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the place to the keeping of the women. If it came
to a fight he would need every man he had.</p>

<p>On that first day those on the yacht were alert
and excited, but the marked composure on the part
of their besiegers gradually quieted their fears of
immediate violence. The decks were not really
dangerous, although constantly under the observation
of the men in the rock fortresses, so they
ventured to use them freely. At one time, when
Chesty Todd made a feint of landing on the shore,
a group of Mexicans quickly gathered to prevent
his leaving the ship, thus demonstrating their
open enmity.</p>

<p>"This won't do!" declared Steve, savagely, as
he faced the company assembled around the cabin
table that evening. "Those infernal bandits mean
to keep us here till doomsday&mdash;or until we go crazy
and surrender. They'll make our lives miserable
unless we dislodge them from those rocks."</p>

<p>"I prefer them there to having them attempt
to scale the sides of our ship," returned Chesty.
"A hand-to-hand fight would be far more serious."</p>

<p>"Interesting, isn't it?" said Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p>"I don't think they care for a hand-to-hand
fight," observed the captain. "Such fellows as
this Ramon Ganza are always cowards."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Madeline. "He
has faced all the men he brought here and in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of their numbers and their hatred of him has
cowed them, every one, single-handed."</p>

<p>"Ramon is not a coward," the child Chica
declared very positively. "He is bad; yes. But
not a coward."</p>

<p>"He has sixteen men&mdash;with himself, seventeen&mdash;and
we have but eleven," said Steve. "However,
the advantage is with us, because the yacht
is a fort."</p>

<p>"You spoke a moment ago of dislodging them,"
remarked Radley-Todd. "Can't we manage to do
that, Steve?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"If we could make some bombs," suggested the
press-agent, slowly, "and hurl them among those
rocks, I've an idea we could drive them away."</p>

<p>Steve was thoughtful a moment.</p>

<p>"We'd need nitro-glycerine for that," said he.
"I suppose there's none aboard, Captain Krell?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"Plenty nitro-glycerine at big islan'," announced
Pietro. "Ramon use it to blast rock."</p>

<p>"Ah, but that's a good way off," declared Steve.</p>

<p>Chesty drummed on the table, musingly.</p>

<p>"If Pietro will go with me," he said presently,
"I'll get you the nitro-glycerine."</p>

<p>"You're crazy, man!"</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Chesty, with a smile. "Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
man belonging to Ramon's band is now here. I'm
not afraid of the women he has left back there."</p>

<p>"But how will you get there&mdash;swim?"</p>

<p>"We'll take the launch, Pietro and I, and run
the blockade at dead of night."</p>

<p>"No," said Madeline, with decision, "I can't
allow that. It would be too dangerous an
undertaking. You might be captured."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. If we are discovered, your
launch can outrun theirs and I'll lead them a
merry chase and come back again. What do you
say, Pietro?"</p>

<p>"Who? Me, Se&ntilde;or? Why, Ramon my enemy
now. So I go with you."</p>

<p>"You needn't fear Ramon, Pietro," said Madeline,
gently. "We shall manage in some way to
get you safely back to Mexico."</p>

<p>The man's expression was stolid and unbelieving.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't dare go back to Mexico,"
said Sybil.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;" replied Pietro. "I not 'fraid of
Mexico. I smuggle, sometimes, before Ramon get
me; but they forget all that by now. It is Ramon
I fear. He is very bad man, as little Chica say.
Always he wins, never he loses, in what he tries
to do. For me, I have disobey an' defy him, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>Ramon he whip me sure, when he catch me, an'
when Ramon whip it is as bad as to die."</p>

<p>It was impossible to overcome this stubborn
belief in Ramon's omnipotence and they did not
argue with the man further. But Orissa, who had
been thoughtfully listening to the conversation,
now said:</p>

<p>"I do not like the plan of bringing nitro-glycerine
here, even if Chesty could succeed in getting
it. The stuff would be dangerous to us and to our
enemies, for a slight accident would explode it or
careless handling might blow us all to eternity.
But, admitting you made the bombs, without accident
to any of our party, what would be the result
of exploding them among those little rock forts
yonder? Wouldn't the rocks scatter in every
direction and bombard us and the ship, perhaps
causing damage that would be fatal to our hopes
of escape?"</p>

<p>"Orissa is quite right," said Mr. Cumberford,
decisively. "We must abandon the idea at once."</p>

<p>"I know it appears a desperate measure,"
admitted Radley-Todd, "but something must be
done, both to drive away our enemies and get the
<i>Salvador</i> afloat again. Cut the explosives, and
what remains for us to do?"</p>

<p>"Make a sortie and drive them away from
here," replied Cumberford. "I'm a little old for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>a pitched battle or guerrilla warfare, but this
extraordinary Mexican&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;interests me. I'm
willing to have it out with him here and now."</p>

<p>"One white man is worth six Mexicans,"
declared Captain Krell, belligerently.</p>

<p>"Won't do at all," asserted Steve. "We can't
afford to take the chances of defeat, gentlemen,
while we have these girls in our care. The ship
is a fort that is almost impregnable, and we
mustn't leave it for an instant&mdash;under any
circumstances."</p>

<small>CAPTURING AN A&Euml;ROPLANE</small></h2>


<p>As they sat with downcast countenances, reflecting
upon their uncomfortable position, Orissa said
quietly:</p>

<p>"I've thought of something to relieve us. The
idea came to me when Chesty insisted our launch
could run the blockade."</p>

<p>"Speak out, Ris," exclaimed Steve. "Your
ideas are pretty good ones, as a rule. What's the
proposition?"</p>

<p>"Why, we all seem to have forgotten the Hy."</p>

<p>"The Hydro-Aircraft?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is lying quite safe, and in apple-pie
order, in the little ravine at the foot of the bluff
where we camped."</p>

<p>"But it is minus its plane-cloths," added Sybil.
"Our tent is still standing, for I saw it from deck
only an hour ago."</p>

<p>"It won't take long to attach the plane-cloths,"
said Steve, "provided those brigands will let us
do it. It's rather odd they haven't taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
trouble to capture the Aircraft already. It would
be easy for Ramon to declare it 'wreck.'"</p>

<p>"What would be the use?" asked Madeline.
"They could not fly it, even if they knew how to
put it in order; and, as they imagine we cannot
get to it, they are not worrying about the thing.
Of course they are able to see that tent on the
bluff as easily as we can, and by and by they will
go there and capture whatever the girls left."</p>

<p>"True. That is why we must lose no unnecessary
time," observed Orissa.</p>

<p>"I do not yet see what the proposition is,"
asserted Chesty, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"I know what Orissa means," returned Steve
quickly. "There's plenty of gasoline on board&mdash;I
think nearly a barrel&mdash;intended for the use of
the launch. If I could get to the Aircraft and fill
its tanks with gasoline no one could prevent my
flying home, where I could get a ship and men to
come to our rescue."</p>

<p>"That interests me; it does, really!" said
Mr. Cumberford. "It's so easy and practical
I wonder none of us thought of it before."</p>

<p>"I've had the possibilities in mind for some
time," declared Orissa, "but I had no idea we
could get to the Aircraft until Chesty proposed
running the blockade in our launch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a fine idea," said Chesty, with enthusiasm.
"I mean both our ideas&mdash;the combination,
Orissa."</p>

<p>"I believe it will solve all our difficulties,"
added Madeline, confidently. "But will not this
journey be a hazardous one for Mr. Kane to
undertake?"</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Orissa. "The same
amount of gasoline that brought Sybil and me to
this place will carry the machine back again, and
Steve can go more directly than we came, for he
knows exactly how to head."</p>

<p>"Then!" said Chesty Todd, "the plan is this:
We'll put enough gasoline in cans to fill the tanks
of the a&euml;roplane, load 'em into the launch, and
to-night Steve and I will sneak out of this inlet,
slip past the Mexican's launch and hie us to that
ravine of yours. Is there room enough for our
boat to enter the bay you described, or is that
big rock too close to shore to let us pass?"</p>

<p>"There will be just about room for you to pass
in, I think," answered Orissa.</p>

<p>"But the big launch couldn't do it?"</p>

<p>"Ramon's? No, indeed."</p>

<p>"Very good."</p>

<p>"Who will fly with me to San Diego?" asked
Steve. "The Aircraft carries two, you know.
One of the women ought to go. I wish we could
carry them all away from this dangerous place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them draw cuts for it," suggested Chesty.</p>

<p>"You can let me out," said Sybil; "I won't
leave Daddy."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried her father.</p>

<p>"Then I'm nonsensical," laughed Sybil, "for
I won't budge an inch without you. That wicked
Mexican might capture you in a jiffy if I wasn't
here to look after you. Not a word, sir; the thing
is settled, as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"I cannot go, of course," said Madeline. "This
is my yacht and I must stand by it, and by my
men, to the last. Nor could I with courtesy escape
and leave my guests in danger."</p>

<p>"Then it shall be Mrs. Tupper," proposed
Orissa.</p>

<p>"Me? Me? Goodness sakes, child," cried Mrs.
Tupper, in great alarm, "do you think I'd risk
my life in that dreadful airship?"</p>

<p>"You'll risk it by staying," suggested her
husband.</p>

<p>"But there's a chance of salvation here,"
asserted the lady, with nervous haste. "I'd get
light-headed and tumble out of that a&euml;roplane
in two minutes. And they'd hear me yell from
Japan to San Francisco, I'd be so scared. I can
stand death, Mr. Tupper, with Christian fortitude;
but not torture!"</p>

<p>"Orissa?" said Steve, inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I'll go. I may be of more assistance to
you all by going than by staying. And I will run
the machine, Steve, and take you as a passenger.
I've tinkered that steering-gear until I know just
how to manage it."</p>

<p>Steve nodded.</p>

<p>"As I understand it, Miss Dentry," said he,
"my mission will be to charter a fast steamship,
for which Mr. Cumberford and I will pay, and
bring it here to drag the <i>Salvador</i> off this beach.
The crew, which I will see is well armed, will work
in conjunction with yours and when we outnumber
Ramon Ganza's band of rascals he will probably
run away to his den without attempting to fight."</p>

<p>"Ramon never run," protested Pietro, shaking
his head. "You cannot scare Ramon. The more
men you bring, the more he has to fight; that is
all."</p>

<p>This gloomy prophecy made them look grave
for a time.</p>

<p>"Our Pietro is a pessimist," said Chesty, with
assumed cheerfulness. "But some day the Mexican
government will find this invincible hero and
send a warship to blow his island out of the
water."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes!" exclaimed Madeline, with sudden
inspiration; "the Mexican government is interested
in this affair. Why not fly to the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
point on the Mexican coast, Mr. Kane, and from
there telegraph President Madero? I believe he
would send a warship at once, both to capture
Ramon Ganza and to rescue us from his clutches."</p>

<p>"Um-m. Madero has his hands full, just now,
putting down revolutions at home," Mr. Cumberford
reminded her. "And maybe he isn't
interested in Ganza, who was convicted of a felony
under the régime of Diaz."</p>

<p>"I can try him, anyhow," said Steve. "The
Mexican coast is about fifty miles nearer than
San Diego."</p>

<p>"Madero has offer one thousan' dollar&mdash;Mexican&mdash;for
capture of Ramon," said Pietro, proudly.
"So much money shows Ramon is great man."</p>

<p>"In that case you'd better give Madero a chance
at him, Steve," decided Mr. Cumberford. "A
man-o'-war would be more effective here than a
trading ship, and in the interests of humanity we
should put an end to this fellow's cruel tyranny
for good and all. He's far better off in jail."</p>

<p>After some further discussion this plan was
finally decided on and preparations were begun
for the adventure. During the afternoon the cans
of gasoline were placed in the launch and Steve
went over the machinery of the little boat with
great care, to assure himself it was in perfect
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The nights were never really dark until toward
morning, when the stars seemed to dim and the
moon dipped below the horizon. Sometimes there
were a few drifting clouds, but they never
obscured the sky long enough to be utilized as a
mask. So Steve decided to make his attempt at
the dark hour preceding dawn and made Orissa
go to bed and get what sleep she could. She said
her good-byes to the others then, so it would not
be necessary to disturb them at the time of
departure.</p>

<p>At three o'clock her brother called her and told
her to get ready. Chesty and Steve were seated
in the launch when the girl arrived on deck, and
she quickly took her place. While it was much
darker than it had been earlier in the night, Orissa
found she could see near-by objects quite distinctly.
Four of the crew, headed by Captain
Krell, were standing by to lower the launch over
the side, and as the owls were hooting their most
dismal chorus their screams drowned any noise
made by the windlass.</p>

<p>No sooner had the launch touched the surface
than Chesty dipped his scull in the water and
with a dexterous motion sent the little craft forward
toward the mouth of the inlet. They might
have been seen from the shore had the Mexicans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>been alert, but at this hour many who were supposed
to be watching had fallen asleep, and if
any remained awake their eyes were not turned
upon the waters of the tiny bay. Quite noiselessly
the launch moved on and presently turned the
point of rock at the right.</p>

<p>Orissa stifled a cry and Steve's heart gave a
bound as the bow of the launch pointed straight
at the big boat of Ramon, scarcely ten feet distant;
but Chesty saw the danger, too, and a sharp
swing of the scull sent the light craft spinning
around so that it just grazed the side of the
Mexican's boat, in which all the occupants were
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Next moment they had passed it, and still
Chesty continued sculling, as it was not safe as
yet to start the engines. But when they had
skirted the shore for such a distance that the
screeching of the owls would be likely to drown
the noise of their motor, Steve started the
machinery and the launch darted away at full
speed.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they crept between the big
rock and the bluff and were safe in the deep hollow
at the foot of the ravine, having accomplished the
adventure so easily that they marvelled at their
own success.</p>

<p>"Strikes me as a good omen," remarked Orissa,
cheerfully, as they disembarked and drew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
launch upon the sands. "I hope the luck will follow
you on your return, Chesty."</p>

<p>"Me?" replied the big boy. "Why, nothing
ever happens to me. Let us hope the good luck
will follow you and Steve, on whom the safety of
the entire party now depends. What first, Steve?</p>

<p>"The tent. We must get that down before daybreak,
so they won't see us working on it from the
bay, and interfere with our proposed flight."</p>

<p>Orissa led the way to the bluff and at once Steve
and Chesty began tumbling the rocks from the
edges of the canvas. This was no light task, for
the girls had erected a solid parapet in order to
defy the wind; but just as the first streaks of dawn
appeared the tent came down and they hastily
seized the canvas, added it to the covering of the
upper plane, which had been inside the tent, and
lugged it all down the incline to where the frame
of the Aircraft lay.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Steve. "We'll need the daylight
now, in order to attach the cloth."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, and while Steve,
assisted by Radley-Todd, fastened the cloth in
place with the clips provided for that purpose,
which Orissa had carefully saved, the girl herself
inspected the machinery and all the framework,
even to the last brace, to be sure it was in condition
for the long trip. She also oiled the steering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
gear and thoroughly tested it to see that it worked
freely.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the planes were tautly spread
and the tanks had been filled with gasoline.</p>

<p>"I think we are all ready for the start," said
Steve. "But how about you, Chesty? As soon
as we roll the Aircraft to the top of the bluff the
Mexicans will see us and start for this place to
try to intercept us. Orissa and I will be gone,
when they arrive; but they may find you, unless
you make tracks."</p>

<p>"How do you expect to regain the ship?"
asked Orissa, who had not considered this matter
before.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, I beg of you,"
retorted the boy, hastily. "I shall be all right.
All ready, Steve?"</p>

<p>Steve looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I think that when they see us fly away they
may give up the idea of coming here," said he;
"and, in that case, you'd better lie here in the
ravine until night, when you can try to steal back
in the same way we came."</p>

<p>"All right, old man; never mind me."</p>

<p>"But we <i>do</i> mind you, Chesty," said Orissa,
earnestly. "You've been a faithful friend ever
since we got into this difficulty&mdash;and before, too&mdash;so
we can't have anything happen to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>He blushed like a girl, but declared he would be
perfectly safe.</p>

<p>"Don't take any foolish chances," urged
Orissa.</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>They rolled the Aircraft up to the top of the
bluff and set it with the head facing the sea.
Then Steve and Orissa took their places and
Chesty, giving them each a hearty handclasp,
spun the propeller blade as Steve started the
engine.</p>

<p>At once the a&euml;roplane darted forward, rose as
it passed the bluff, and sailed gracefully into the
air. Chesty hid his six-feet-three behind a
boulder, to shield himself from observation, while
he watched the splendid machine turn upon its
course and speed away over the Pacific on its
errand of rescue.</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh of relief and elation, the boy
crept into the ravine and descended to where his
boat lay. Seated in the launch, calmly awaiting
him, were three of the Mexicans, headed by the
one-eyed Francisco.</p>

<small>RAMON GANZA</small></h2>


<p>When Madeline came on deck, soon after daybreak,
Captain Krell reported the successful
departure of the launch.</p>

<p>"Are you sure they were not seen?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Miss Dentry, for we heard not a
sound, either from our party or from the
besiegers, although we listened intently."</p>

<p>Long before Steve could have prepared the
a&euml;roplane for the journey those on board the
yacht were gazing expectantly at the bluff. The
tent had disappeared, which was proof that the
undertaking had so far been successful.</p>

<p>At this time there seemed to be a little stir
among the Mexicans and Mr. Cumberford suggested,
rather nervously, that they also had
noticed the absence of the tent, without understanding
what could have become of it.</p>

<p>At half-past eight they heard the sound of the
engines of Ramon's big launch, and that made
them worry more than ever until Sybil suddenly
cried: "There they are!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the distant bluff appeared the Aircraft.
A little cheer, which none could restrain, went up
from the deck of the yacht. There was no delay.
Scarcely was the machine in position when it
mounted into the air and headed directly toward
the east. Every eye watched it eagerly until it
had become a dim speck against the blue sky and
finally disappeared from view altogether, flying
steadily and with a speed that raised their hopes
to the highest pitch. Then, with one accord, they
returned to the cabin to discuss the chances of
Radley-Todd's getting back to them safely with
the launch.</p>

<p>"I don't worry much about that young man,"
said Cumberford. "He's as full of resources as
a pincushion is of sawdust, and I'll bet my hat
we shall soon see him again, safe and sound."</p>

<p>The captain now entered with an anxious face.</p>

<p>"That confounded Mexican king is signaling
us with a flag of truce," he reported.</p>

<p>"What, Ramon?" exclaimed Madeline.</p>

<p>"Yes. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Stay here, Miss Dentry," said Cumberford,
rising. "I'll go and see what the fellow wants."</p>

<p>"I will go with you," returned Madeline,
quietly.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" she asked. "If he bears a flag of
truce there is no danger."</p>

<p>"I do not believe he would respect a flag of
truce&mdash;nor anything else," asserted Mr. Cumberford.
"Do you, Captain?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He's tricky and unreliable. Don't
trust him for a moment."</p>

<p>But Madeline would not be denied. She accompanied
the captain and Mr. Cumberford to the
deck.</p>

<p>Just beside the yacht floated the little rowboat
which had been brought from Ramon's island,
and in it sat Ramon himself, all alone, holding
aloft a handkerchief attached as a flag to a boat-hook.</p>

<p>As they peered over the side at him he bowed
profoundly and removed his hat to Miss Dentry.
He was still clothed in his white flannels and his
fingers glittered with jewels.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Mr. Cumberford
sharply.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of conversing with you, se&ntilde;or,"
was the confident reply. "If you will kindly let
down your ladder I will come on board. You see,
myself I place in your power. We have, I much
regret, some slight misunderstanding between us,
which a few words will assuredly correct."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't let him up, sir," advised Captain Krell,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"But he is unarmed," said Madeline. "I think
it will be best to confer with him."</p>

<p>"Then do it from a distance," grumbled the
captain.</p>

<p>"Sir," called Mr. Cumberford, "if you have
any apologies to make, you may speak from where
you are."</p>

<p>"Then, alas, my overtures of peace are
refused?" said Ramon, not defiantly, but in a
tone of deep regret.</p>

<p>"No; we don't refuse any sincere overtures of
peace; but you have treated us in a scoundrelly
manner, and we don't trust you."</p>

<p>"Such a terrible mistake, se&ntilde;or; so sad! But
I cannot explain it from here. With utmost trust
in your honor I offer to come to you alone, and&mdash;see!&mdash;unarmed.
Will not you, for the sake of the
ladies who are with you, encourage my friendliness?"</p>

<p>"Let him come up," said Madeline again.
There seemed a veiled threat in Ramon's appeal.</p>

<p>"Very well. But tell your men to watch his
every movement, Captain, and if he makes a
treacherous move shoot him down without hesitation."</p>

<p>The rope ladder was cast over the side and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Ramon promptly seized it and climbed to the
deck.</p>

<p>"Follow us below," commanded Mr. Cumberford,
turning toward the cabin. The man hesitated,
casting a shrewd, quick glance around.
Then he bowed again and said:</p>

<p>"I thank the se&ntilde;or for his courtesy."</p>

<p>In the cabin were assembled Mr. and Mrs. Tupper
and Sybil Cumberford. Chica and Pietro
discreetly kept out of view. Mr. Cumberford
entered first, followed by Madeline. Then came
Ramon Ganza and behind him the captain and
little O'Reilly, the Irish engineer. This last personage
was virtually "armed to the teeth," for
he carried one of Ramon's own rifles and a brace
of revolvers.</p>

<p>"Be seated," said Mr. Cumberford, pointing
to a chair. "And now, sir, state your errand."</p>

<p>Ganza's comprehensive glance had taken in
every member of the party, as well as the luxurious
furnishings of the <i>Salvador's</i> cabin, which
seemed to please his aesthetic taste.</p>

<p>"I ask to be inform, being in ignorance, if
three people may ride in one flying-machine," he
blandly announced, looking from one face to
another as if uncertain whom to address.</p>

<p>"Three?" asked Cumberford, as if puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I see that one young lady and two men
are missing from your party."</p>

<p>"I suppose three can ride, if need be," muttered
Cumberford. "Is your mission here to gain
information concerning a&euml;roplanes?"</p>

<p>"Only in part, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>The Mexican's features had hitherto been composed
and smiling, despite the stern and mistrustful
looks he encountered on all sides. But
now, perhaps understanding that these Americans
were not easily to be cajoled, his own face grew
somber and lowering and he said in a sharp,
incisive manner: "You prefer to discuss business
only?"</p>

<p>"We do, sir," was the reply, Mr. Cumberford
continuing to act as spokesman.</p>

<p>"Very nice. I have a wish to invite you all to
my island, where you shall be my respected
guests. My mansion shall be at your service; my
servants shall obey your commands; you shall
delight in the grand scenery and enjoy yourselves
as you will."</p>

<p>"Thank you; we decline your hospitality."</p>

<p>"But I fear in that you make bad mistake,
se&ntilde;or," continued Ramon Ganza, unabashed by
the rebuff. "My island is a pleasant place, and
where else can you find so much happiness when
my ship, which you now inhabit, is destroyed?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh; that's the idea, is it?" exclaimed Mr.
Cumberford. "You interest me, sir; you do,
really. Perhaps you will state how you intend to
destroy our ship, which is not, permit me to say,
your ship as yet."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary to say more?" asked the Mexican,
spreading out his jewelled hands with a
deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>"I think it will enable us to understand you
better."</p>

<p>As if in deep thought, Ganza drummed upon
the cabin table with his fingers.</p>

<p>"I am very sad at your refusal to be my
guests," he said after a time. "This, my ship, is
in a most dangerous position. It is half out of
water, on an island that is a bleak rock. I come
here from the island where I reside to befriend
you&mdash;to offer you my humble hospitality&mdash;when
I have taken possession of the wreck&mdash;and in your
blindness&mdash;do you call it fatuity?&mdash;you receive
me as an enemy. Some of your people chase my
boat, as if I have no right to sail the seas of my
own islands! Yet I am not resentful; not at all.
I enjoy some humor and I am good man, with
much respectability. When your ship catches on
fire, as it will probably do very soon, you must
escape to these bare rocks, where you can find no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>assistance, no food to keep you alive. Then perhaps
you will feel more kindly toward poor Don
Miguel del Borgitis&mdash;your humble servant&mdash;and
find willingness to accept his beautiful home as
your own. But why wait for fire to drive you to
death most terrible or to my great hospitality?
Is it not the best to accept my offer, and so save
yourselves from&mdash;inconvenience?"</p>

<p>Beneath the smooth words the ugly threat was
so visible that even brave Madeline paled, and Mr.
Tupper shuddered vigorously. But Mr. Cumberford,
gazing critically into the man's face,
replied:</p>

<p>"I see. Interesting; very. You want to save
this yacht. You would like to drag it afloat and
carry it away to your own island, where we,
accepting your hospitality, would become your
prisoners. But if we refuse to surrender the ship,
you say you will set fire to it, in which case you
would burn us up or force us to land. If we land,
you will capture us and force us to become your
unwilling subjects. Is that a clear understanding
of your statement, Ramon Ganza?"</p>

<p>The outlaw gave a start as he heard his true
name mentioned, but quickly recovered his
assurance.</p>

<p>"The se&ntilde;or is very intelligent," he said.</p>

<p>"At any rate, the se&ntilde;or is not demented,"
retorted Cumberford, grimly. "Why did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
venture to place yourself in our power, Ramon
Ganza, and then threaten us as you have done?"</p>

<p>"I came under flag of truce."</p>

<p>"And you think, on that account, we will let
you go again, to carry out your cowardly
designs?"</p>

<p>"I am certain of that. Before I came I took
care to protect myself."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, a huge jewelled affair.</p>

<p>"Underneath your ship," said he quietly, "is
anchored a mine of very much power. It lies
under that part which is in the water&mdash;I think
just below the place where we now sit. If I do
not depart from here in safety within fifty minutes
from now, my men will kindly explode this
mine and blow us all to&mdash;well, where we go. The
poor ship, alas, will be destroyed with us."</p>

<p>"Would your men execute such an absurd
order?" asked Cumberford sneeringly.</p>

<p>"With much satisfaction. You see, it would
make them free. They do not love me very much.
If I die, they will have my beloved island and all
my possessions&mdash;so they think."</p>

<p>"And you would be willing to forfeit your life
as the alternative of not getting control of this
yacht? Do you expect us to believe that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The outlaw's glittering fingers drummed upon
the table again.</p>

<p>"The se&ntilde;or is not so wholly intelligent as I
believed," said he. "I do not contradict his statement
that he is not&mdash;eh&mdash;what you call it?&mdash;demented,
or a fool; but the statement seems open
to suspicion."</p>

<p>"Ah; that interests me."</p>

<p>"It ought to. You seem to know my name,
se&ntilde;or; therefore you doubtless know my history.
Pietro will have told you, or Chica, for both are
now with you. My safety has depended on my
keeping hidden upon my island. I must not let
any who has seen me there, and recognized Ramon
Ganza, depart to carry the tale to the mainland.
In Mexico a price is set upon my head and they
have condemned me to years in prison. But&mdash;there!
I assure you all that I am good man,
and honest; but my enemies have conspired to
destroy me.</p>

<p>"As Don Miguel del Borgitis I have lived very
respectable until, unfortunately for us all, you
came here. I knew two girls had been wreck on
this island in a flying-machine&mdash;a very strange
and exciting invention, is it not?&mdash;but I did not
disturb them nor allow them to become aware of
my existence. Why? All I wish is safety. When
some of you people, after this yacht is driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
ashore in storm, intrude on me by coming to my
hiding-place, I was obliged to protect myself. I
started to come here to get every one on board
and invite them to my island&mdash;where I meant to
keep you all indefinitely, for I did not dare allow
you to return to America and say where you had
found Ramon Ganza. This yacht I could use to
advantage, I admit; but I would be better pleased
had I never seen it&mdash;nor you.</p>

<p>"Almost at once you are my enemies, and defy
my laws. That did not change my plans except
to make them harder. In this unknown island I
am really king. I must conquer you, which I
thought with good reason I could easily accomplish
in time. So I make siege to your boat,
laughing to think you cannot escape me. But one
man cannot comprehend all things, se&ntilde;or, and I
failed to consider that devilish contrivance, your
flying-machine. I thought it was wreck, and no
good any more. Some time last night three of
your party get away and go to flying-machine,
and this morning some of them&mdash;one, two, three;
it does not matter&mdash;have fly away in it. Of
course they will go to the mainland. That means
they send assistance to you. They float your ship,
take you back to America and you all have knowledge
where Ramon Ganza may be found by those
that seek his capture. Now you understand me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
do you not? You have make it very unpleasant
for me. If I escape from my island in little boat,
where can I got? If I stay I will be arrest and
carried to Mexico to be put in prison. Very well;
I must escape. But not in my launch, which is
old and not very good. I must have this yacht,
which will carry me to any far part of the world,
where Mexico is not known. Perhaps in it I could
be privateer, if that seemed best way to protect
my liberty&mdash;which is dearer to me than life. With
this yacht I could defy all enemies; without it&mdash;I
face death, or at least ruin. You have driven me
to this desperation, so I come to make you my
proposition. Now that I have explained all with
much frankness, you will understand I mean what
I say, for I am talking for my liberty&mdash;the liberty
of a man who would soon die in confinement, for
I am used to the open and could not exist as a convicted
felon, in chains and abused by dogs of
jailers. For your party I have no especial enmity;
neither do I care for you the snap of my fingers.
But believe this: Either I will save myself in this
yacht, as I have proposed, or I will die in your
company."</p>

<small>A DESPERATE ALTERNATIVE</small></h2>


<p>Ramon Ganza had spoken slowly and with
deliberation, choosing his words with care. His
story seemed plausible, except where it referred
to the planting of the mine, which he claimed to
be the last resort of a man so desperately situated.
Some of his hearers were quite convinced
of his sincerity in making this statement, but Mr.
Cumberford was not among them. He remembered
Chica's artless statement: "Ramon lies; he
always lies," and it confirmed his skepticism.</p>

<p>"As I understand you," he made answer, after
a little thought, "you consider your retreat no
longer safe because we have discovered it. Therefore,
on obtaining possession of this yacht, you
propose to sail to parts unknown, leaving us
stranded on this rocky island."</p>

<p>"From whence you will soon be rescued," added
the outlaw, with a bow.</p>

<p>"The siege which you had planned, in order to
force us to surrender through starvation, is no
longer practical; for time presses and if you delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
you will be surprised by the ship sent to rescue
us&mdash;perhaps a Mexican man-o'-war."</p>

<p>The man nodded, watching the speaker's face
with an eagerness he could not dissemble.</p>

<p>"For which reason," continued Mr. Cumberford,
"you decided to force a climax by coming on
board and threatening us&mdash;as you have done.
Well, we intend to force your alternative, Ramon
Ganza. You are our prisoner, and if your men
blow up this yacht you shall go to eternity with
us!"</p>

<p>The Mexican's face grew rigid a moment. Then
he smiled in a sardonic way and shrugged his
shoulders. But Mr. Tupper, white and trembling
as with an ague, leaped to his feet and cried:</p>

<p>"In heaven's name, Cumberford, what do you
mean? Would you destroy us all in this heartless
fashion?"</p>

<p>"No. There is no mine; or, if there is, it will
not explode."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I differ with you. This&mdash;er&mdash;person&mdash;is
desperate. He&mdash;he knows what he's talking
about. I refuse to ta-ta-take the chances, sir! I
must consider the safety of my wife and myself,
and of our niece, Miss Dentry. This is our
yacht, Cumberford, not yours, I beg to remind
you, and we shall decide this important question
ourselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Even before he ceased speaking Mrs. Tupper,
whose eyes had been wild and staring, uttered a
piercing shriek and tumbled to the floor of the
cabin in violent hysterics. Sybil and Madeline
rushed to her assistance and this confusion further
unnerved Mr. Tupper. With sudden energy
he pounded his fist upon the table and cried:</p>

<p>"I won't allow it! I won't allow this sacrifice.
Madeline is rich; what does she care for this
miserable yacht? Take it, you Mexican thief, if
you want it! Our lives are far too precious to be
put in peril."</p>

<p>Ramon Ganza's face showed his satisfaction but
his eyes expressed nothing but contempt for the
terrified Mr. Tupper. Mr. Cumberford sat calmly
regarding the contortions of the afflicted lady, as
if wondering how much was involuntary and how
much pure perversity. The captain twirled his
thumbs and seemed absolutely unconcerned, while
little O'Reilly's attention was fixed, in keen
amusement, on the scene before him, as if it were
a vaudeville act performed for his especial edification.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Tupper continued to pound the floor
with her heels Madeline first emptied the water
pitcher over her aunt and then slyly pinched her,
which torture may have been responsible for some
of the frantic screams. Mr. Tupper bowed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
head despairingly on the cabin table, in an attitude
so pitiable that it should have aroused the
sympathy of all beholders, as he intended it to
do. But meanwhile his good wife gradually
recovered; her screams subsided to heart-rending
wails and then to moans, after which she became
quiet except for a series of nervous sobs. Madeline
and Sybil now raised the poor woman and
supported her to her stateroom, where she fell
exhausted upon the berth.</p>

<p>It was not until the girls returned to the cabin
that the discussion of Ramon Ganza's proposition
was renewed. Miss Dentry gave him a searching
look as she entered and noted the outlaw's smirk
of satisfaction and the triumphant glitter of the
dark eyes beneath their half closed lids. Then
her own expression hardened and she turned to
Mr. Cumberford, as if inviting him to proceed.</p>

<p>"Madeline," implored Mr. Tupper, "be good
enough to assure this man&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;eh&mdash;Ganza&mdash;that
the yacht, which is your property,
is at his disposal in return for our&mdash;safety."</p>

<p>"The yacht is really Miss Dentry's property,"
added Mr. Cumberford coolly. "She will dispose
of it as she thinks fit."</p>

<p class="center">Madeline, seated at the table, studied the faces before
her curiously, while an amused smile played around her
lips. "We cannot accept our enemy's proposition," she
announced.</p>
</div>
</div>




<p>Madeline, seated at the table, studied the faces
before her curiously, while an amused smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>played around her lips. She knew she was enjoying
the scene, and also knew the moment was
critical, but no fear of consequences caused her
courageous heart to falter an instant.</p>

<p>"We cannot accept our enemy's proposition,"
she announced. "Ramon Ganza is not the man
to abide by any promises he makes, and if once
we left the protection of this yacht we would
probably be treated with little mercy. It would
not save a single life, Uncle Martin, to agree to
Ganza's proposal. Threatening and browbeating
those weaker than himself seems to be the man's
pet recreation and before he left the island he
would leave us to our fate, virtual prisoners. It
might be years before any ship chanced to sail
this way."</p>

<p>"I give you my pledge of honor to send word
to your friends where you are," protested Ganza,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"As you have no honor, sir, your word has no
value. But I have a counter-proposition to suggest
which will, I think, satisfy all concerned.
Order your men, Ramon Ganza, to lay down their
arms and surrender themselves to our keeping
and to obey us unreservedly. Then, under command
of Captain Krell, all hands must attempt to
get the yacht afloat in deep water. When that is
accomplished we will take you with us back to
the United States and secretly land you in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
port you select. Afterward we will not betray
you nor attempt to hunt you down. If you need
money, I will even supply you with a small sum
that will enable you to flee to Europe or South
America. That is fair. It is more fair than you
deserve. But, if you accept our terms, we will
abide by them faithfully."</p>

<p>The Mexican was intensely annoyed.</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed, abruptly. "If you cannot
trust me, why should I trust you?"</p>

<p>"Because my plan is by far the better way,"
she rejoined. "If you seek liberty, if you desire
to avoid arrest, this plan will surely accomplish
your purpose. You cannot prefer prison to
assured freedom, and the alternative, if you reject
my plan, is simply to explode your mine."</p>

<p>He drummed on the table again, rather nervously.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss Dentry," said Cumberford,
"but you are proposing to aid and abet the escape
of a condemned criminal. You will render yourself,
and us, liable to punishment."</p>

<p>"I know," she answered. "I despise myself for
treating with this scoundrel, but do it to relieve
the fears of the Tuppers and perhaps others
aboard who have not yet protested. If I dared
follow my own counsel I would defy him, as you
have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear sir," said Mr. Tupper, looking at the
Mexican beseechingly, "accept Miss Dentry's
terms, I implore you. She will do exactly as she
agrees; she always does!"</p>

<p>"Puh!" muttered Ganza, uneasily shifting in
his chair; "perhaps we can arrange. But the
trust shall not be all on one side. If I trust you,
you must trust me&mdash;to an extent&mdash;a few more
details. Instead of giving you my men, you must
give me yours, and place all weapons in my control.
Also I will take command of this yacht, for
I am good sailor. In an hour's time I will float
the ship; then, with my men, I will sail it back to
United States, to land your party on the coast
near to some city which you can reach easily by
walking. After that I will sail away in this yacht,
which you will present to me in return for my
services to you. You see, in this way you assure
absolute safety to yourselves. As this wise and
agreeable gentleman," indicating Mr. Tupper,
"has with cleverness stated, the young lady is
rich enough to afford the loss of her boat, so you
can have no objection to my generous proposition."</p>

<p>"None whatever!" exclaimed Mr. Tupper.
"Agree, Madeline, agree!"</p>

<p>"No," she said, shaking her head, "I will not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
The man is not sincere, or he would not require
us to place ourselves in his power."</p>

<p>"But I insist, my dear. He&mdash;he seems quite
honest. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, confound you!" roared Cumberford,
losing patience. "You're a doddering old
idiot, Tupper, and if you don't shut up I'll gag
you." He turned to Ganza. "Miss Dentry's
proposition still stands, and it's the final word.
You'll either accept it&mdash;right now, on the spot&mdash;or
take the consequences."</p>

<p>"Already I have refuse," said the outlaw
calmly.</p>

<p>"Very well. O'Reilly, march this fellow to the
cage, for'ard, and lock him in. Then stand guard
before the door and shoot him if he bothers you."</p>

<p>"Thank 'e, sor; it's proud I am to do that
same," answered the engineer, gleefully.</p>

<p>"One moment, please," said Ganza. "You
make doubt of my saying that you all face a most
horrible death. You are stupid Americans, and
must be convinced. Come with me on deck and
I will prove to you your danger."</p>

<p>"No harm in that," replied Cumberford. "It's
on your way to the cage."</p>

<p>With one accord they all accompanied O'Reilly
and his prisoner to the deck.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ramon, standing by the rail, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
have some men hid in those rocks yonder. Their
names are Paschal, Mateo, Gabrielle, Gomez,
Francisco, Pedro, Gonzales, Juan and Tomas.
Tell me which one I shall call&mdash;I care not which,
myself&mdash;and the man will assure you my orders
are positive to them, and that they will carry out
the explosion of the mine as I have arranged,
provided I do not return in safety."</p>

<p>Cumberford was curious to learn the extent of
the rogue's bravado.</p>

<p>"Call Mateo," he suggested.</p>

<p>The Mexican did so, raising his voice to utter
the summons.</p>

<p>From behind a pile of rocks nearly opposite
them sprang a thin, gaunt man. He ran down
to the water's edge, saluted his chief and stood at
attention.</p>

<p>"Come here, Mateo," commanded Ganza.</p>

<p>Without hesitation the man waded into the inlet
and swam to the rope ladder which dangled over
the side. This he seized and climbed on deck,
where, dripping with water, he again faced his
master and saluted him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mateo," said Ramon Ganza, "where
is it, beneath this boat, that the mine has been
planted?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen feet from the stern, Capitan."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"And is it powerful enough to destroy the
ship?"</p>

<p>"To make it in small pieces, Capitan&mdash;an' ten
ship like it, if ten ship were here."</p>

<p>"Very nice. You know what time the mine is
to explode?"</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock, Capitan, unless you come
ashore to countermand the order."</p>

<p>"Ah yes; so it is. You may go back to your
post, Mateo."</p>

<p>The man, looking neither to right nor left,
descended the ladder, swam to shore and retreated
behind the rocks again.</p>

<p>Ramon turned to Mr. Cumberford, showing the
open face of his watch.</p>

<p>"In five minutes it will be eleven o'clock," he
quietly announced.</p>

<p>"Take him to the cage, O'Reilly!"</p>

<p>Two other armed men had joined the engineer
on deck and the three now surrounded Ganza and
started forward with him.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Cumberford! Save us&mdash;save us!"
howled Mr. Tupper, frantic with fear. "I can't
die now&mdash;we ought none of us to die! Give him
the launch. Give him the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cry interrupted him. Mason, the man nearest
the rail, dropped his gun and staggered back
with his hands clasped to his side, from which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
stream of blood gushed forth. At the same
moment the huge form of Ramon Ganza leaped
the rail and dove headforemost into the water.</p>

<p>But everyone else was more interested in the
wounded man, who seemed to be badly hurt.
Ramon Ganza was forgotten as the girls bent over
the poor fellow with anxious looks.</p>

<p>"Have Mason brought to my own cabin, at
once," said Madeline to Captain Krell.</p>

<p>They carried the wounded man below, to be
placed in Madeline's roomy cabin. Mr. Cumberford
was not a surgeon, but there was no one
aboard who knew more of surgery than he and
so he went to Mason's side at once.</p>

<p>Ganza had struck the man with a knife of the
stiletto type, the narrow blade of which had penetrated
his side just above the hip joint. Mr.
Cumberford's "first aid" outfit, which the captain
was able to supply, enabled him to stop the
bleeding, but he was unable to tell how serious
the injury might prove. The man was in considerable
pain, which Cumberford partially
relieved with a hypodermic injection of morphine.</p>

<p>During this interesting period no one gave a
thought to the escaped Mexican, but when nothing
more could be done for his patient Cumberford
left the girls to watch over him and walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>into the cabin, where he found Mrs. Tupper sobbing
as if in great grief while her husband sat in
his favorite despairing attitude, his head bowed
on his arms.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" demanded Cumberford, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Wrong!" cried Tupper, lifting his head;
"why, at any moment may come the crash of the
explosion that will send us all to eternity. We&mdash;we
can't escape it. It's inevitable!"</p>

<p>Cumberford looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It's a quarter to twelve," he said. "The
explosion was due at eleven."</p>

<p>"But the Mexican brigand&mdash;the pirate chief&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has escaped, so there'll be no explosion at
all. I believe he threatened to fire the ship; but
he won't do that. Ganza's sole ambition is to
capture this boat, so he can sail away from his
countrymen, escape imprisonment, and perhaps
become a really-truly pirate. Interesting, isn't it?
Forget the explosion, Tupper; if you must worry,
worry about our real danger."</p>

<p>"What is that, sir? What is our real danger?"
cried Madeline's uncle, springing to his feet in a
new access of terror.</p>

<p>"There'll be fighting, presently," predicted Mr.
Cumberford. "Having failed in all else, the
Mexican will find a way to board us&mdash;in the night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
probably&mdash;and will try to slice us to goulash or
pepper us with bullets, as opportunity decides."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!"</p>

<p>"To be sure. To avoid getting to those great
heavens, where you don't belong, I advise you to
arm yourself properly and be ready to repel the
attack."</p>

<p>Then Cumberford went on deck and found the
captain.</p>

<p>"How about Ramon Ganza?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think Ganza kept swimming and reached the
shore, where his men dragged him to cover. The
fellow seems to bear a charmed life."</p>

<p>"That's bad," observed Cumberford, shaking
his head regretfully. "I've an idea, Captain
Krell, that unless we manage to capture Ramon
Ganza during the next twenty-four hours, he will
manage to capture us."</p>

<p>"So soon?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"He won't dare to wait longer. There's help
coming."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, in that case&mdash;&mdash;" The captain
hesitated.</p>

<p>"In that case it will be pleasanter and more
satisfactory for us to capture Ganza," said Mr.
Cumberford. "Interesting; isn't it?"</p>

<p>"How can we do it?" asked Captain Krell.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Cumberford.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />

<small>THE DIPLOMACY OF CHESTY TODD</small></h2>


<p>When Mr. H. Chesterton Radley-Todd discovered
the one-eyed Francisco and his two comrades
calmly seated in the <i>Salvador's</i> launch, engaged
in nonchalantly smoking their brown-paper cigarettes,
he merely raised his eyebrows and continued
down the slope. They had seen him as soon as
he saw them and, confident in their superior numbers,
awaited his advance with serenity.</p>

<p>Chesty knew there was little chance of escape,
and he knew the men knew he knew it. The
launch was his sole resource, and the enemy had
captured it. He might, perhaps, dodge behind the
rocks on the mountain for an indefinite period,
but they'd get him in the end, so such an undertaking
was scarcely worth the exertion it required.</p>

<p>Therefore, on he came, walking leisurely and
picking his way deliberately down the incline
until he stood beside the launch, which was still
beached upon the shore of the little pocket-like
bay. Then he drew out a silver case and, choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
a cigarette with solicitous care, turned to Francisco
and said:</p>

<p>"Will the se&ntilde;or favor me with a light?"</p>

<p>The men grinned. They enjoyed the humor of
the situation. Francisco, with a bow of mock
deference, furnished the required light from his
own cigarette.</p>

<p>Chesty climbed into the launch, took a seat
facing Francisco and remarked: "Fine day,
se&ntilde;ors."</p>

<p>"Good to fly in air," nodded one of the men,
with a laugh and a glance skyward.</p>

<p>"Oh; did you see the machine fly? Pretty sight,
wasn't it? And you boys saw it for nothing. In
the United States we charge fifty cents to tickle
the vision like that."</p>

<p>Francisco looked at him, meditating.</p>

<p>"Where they go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To Mexico, to ask President Madero for a
battleship."</p>

<p>The men exchanged significant glances.</p>

<p>"For why, se&ntilde;or?" inquired one of them.</p>

<p>"To come and get Ramon Ganza and clap him
in prison. Perhaps hang him to one of those
banana trees, on the bluff up there."</p>

<p>The Mexicans looked their consternation.</p>

<p>"If that is true," said Francisco, slowly, "then
I may be capture an' put in prison, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose so; because you belong to Ganza's
gang and have probably broken the laws more
than once."</p>

<p>"I not murder," protested the man. "Ramon
do that, I know; but not me. I very hones' an'
good. But come," he added, throwing away his
cigarette and rising. "We mus' go back. You
are our prisoner, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>Chesty did not move. He took the silver case
from his pocket and offered it to the Mexicans.</p>

<p>"Help yourselves, boys," he said. "There's
no hurry. Let us sit here and have a little talk.
When you get back to Ramon he'll be sure to keep
you busy enough. This is a good time to rest."</p>

<p>They hesitated a little, but took the cigarettes
and lighted them.</p>

<p>"I suppose," remarked Mr. Todd, leaning back
with his arms clasped around his knees, "if I
asked the warship to take Ganza, and let my
friends&mdash;you are my friends, I suppose?" They
all nodded, watching his face eagerly. "And let
my friends escape&mdash;with me, in our yacht, the
<i>Salvador</i>&mdash;they would do so without question.
Madero knows me, and he usually does what I
ask."</p>

<p>"You know Madero?" asked Francisco, his
back against the boat and his elbows resting on
the gunwale, in a lounging attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are like twin brothers," asserted Chesty.
"That is why he will send a warship to take
Ramon Ganza and all his gang&mdash;except those who
are my friends."</p>

<p>They smoked a while in silence and Chesty
noted that they now forbore meeting one another's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ramon great man," said one, presently, as if
to himself. "Ramon bad master; his people are
dogs; but Ramon have his own way, an' nobody
dare stop him."</p>

<p>"Wrong, my friend," rejoined Mr. Todd.
"Ramon is stopped right now. His time is up;
his days are numbered. He has run the length
of his rope. Presently he'll be confined in a dungeon,
on bread-and-water, or breaking stone on
the roads&mdash;in chains and very miserable. Poor
Ramon. What a fool he was to break the law&mdash;which
leads to breaking stones!"</p>

<p>"Ramon very clever," suggested another man,
but in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>"Cleverness has failed him this time," said
Chesty. "Your leader is caught like a rat in a
trap. If he could get hold of our yacht he'd skip
out and save himself; but he can't do that in a
thousand years."</p>

<p>"An' why not, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"We're too strong for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>They pondered this.</p>

<p>"Ramon have sixteen men," said Francisco,
presently. "You had 'leven; but one fly away,
an' one&mdash;that is you, se&ntilde;or&mdash;is now capture. That
make you nine. Nine to sixteen&mdash;an' Ramon to
lead those sixteen!"</p>

<p>"You didn't remain in school long enough to
complete your education, Francisco," declared the
prisoner, calmly. "In other words, you can't figure.
Here's the real situation, and it's worth
your while to study it: The yacht has a crew of
seven&mdash;all splendid warriors. Then there's General
Cumberford, a terrible fighter, and Major-General
Tupper, who cries every night if he can't
kill a man before he goes to bed&mdash;it makes him
sleep better, you know&mdash;and the invincible Captain
Krell, who once cut down a whole regiment
with his own saber&mdash;chopped them into mince-meat
by the hundreds, and was given a gold medal
with his monogram engraved on it, to commemorate
the event. That's an even ten defenders.
And then there's myself. I won't say much
about myself, but you might look me over carefully.
It is possible that if I was aroused I might
crush you three in my arms until your bones
cracked like walnuts."</p>

<p>They did look at him, and it seemed as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
big fellow might do it, exactly as he said. But
Chesty continued, reassuringly:</p>

<p>"However, I never injure my friends. I'm
noted for that. Let's see; ten in our party, so
far, wasn't it? Then there's that Red-beard&mdash;Pietro&mdash;who
has been given a charm by one of
our witch-women which will not only preserve his
life but enable him to defeat all his enemies.
Pietro desires to return to civilization, a free man,
and we will allow him to do so."</p>

<p>They were much impressed by this statement.
Chesty's idea of the "witch-woman" was destined
to prove his most forceful argument.</p>

<p>"Pietro makes eleven," he continued, "and you
three bring the number up to fourteen, which
leaves Ramon but thirteen followers to be arrested
with him&mdash;unlucky number, thirteen. Haven't
you noticed it?"</p>

<p>"You think we join you, then?" asked Francisco,
curiously.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it. You are no longer afraid of
Ramon, for his jig is up. You don't want to go
to prison with him, because it is very disagreeable
to break stone on the roads, I'm told, and in prison
they deprive a man of even his cigarettes. I know
you have been bad boys, all three of you, and until
now the law has threatened you. But you have
reformed. Remember, se&ntilde;ors, you have reformed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and are now honest men. I will tell Madero, my
friend the president, what honest men you are,
and how you have helped to defy Ramon, the outlaw,
and give him up to justice. Madero will then
reward you, and you will live happy ever after."</p>

<p>It was an enticing picture. The men looked
grave and undecided. In their hearts they hated
Ramon; but they also feared him. For years they
had lived in daily terror of the tyrant who ruled
them with an iron hand, who whipped a man
brutally if he incurred his anger, who dominated
them so utterly that they grovelled at his feet like
the curs they were. If they could be sure of
Ramon's downfall; if they could believe this big
American boy, who was fully as powerful of frame
as Ramon himself, then they would gladly desert
the tyrant and save themselves by joining his
enemies. It was only their inbred fear of Ramon
and their confidence in his cleverness in defying
justice, that made them hesitate.</p>

<p>Chesty saw this. He racked his brain to find
other arguments.</p>

<p>"You have witch-women?" asked one of the
men, in an awed tone.</p>

<p>"Three of them, all very bewitching."</p>

<p>"One has fly away."</p>

<p>"Yes; to cast a spell over the captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Mexican battleship, and make him hurry. The
two most powerful are still here on this island."</p>

<p>"Then why they not use their witchcraft to
push your ship into deep water!" inquired Francisco,
his one eye flashing triumphantly. "Why
the witch-women let Ramon make trouble for you?
Eh? Tell me, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>Chesty looked at the man reproachfully.</p>

<p>"How stupid you are, Francisco. Must we not
keep Ramon busy, to hold him here until the warship
comes? Why do you suppose we came to
this island at all, and ran our ship high on the
beach, without hurting it in any way! Did we
lay a trap for Ramon? Did we coax him to come
and try to capture us, that we might prove he is
a wicked law-breaker? We do not seem much
afraid of your Ramon, do we? Am I frightened?
Do I grow pale, and tremble? Here&mdash;feel my
pulse&mdash;does my blood beat faster in my veins
because Ramon Ganza, the trapped criminal, is
waiting here to be captured, and thinks he is
making us worry?"</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a few sentences in
Spanish. Francisco listened to them and nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>"The case is this, se&ntilde;or," he announced,
addressing Mr. Todd. "We would like to leave
Ramon. We would like to join your ship an' go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
back to Mexico, an' have pardon. But Ramon is
not trap yet. Ramon great man. Many time he
escape. If we leave him, an' he then capture your
ship, Ramon flog us with whip, which make great
pain in us."</p>

<p>"True, that might be the result if Ramon captures
the ship; but he can't do that&mdash;not in a
century of Sundays, which is a long time. And
if you stay with Ramon you will surely be made
prisoners when the warship comes, which will be
in another day or two. You must make up your
minds which is the most powerful&mdash;we and our
witch-women, with the Mexican government and
its warships to back us, or poor Ramon, who is
caught in a trap. I like you, all three&mdash;but not
too much. You are fine men&mdash;unless I am lying&mdash;and
I would grieve to see you imprisoned with
Ramon. But otherwise I do not care what you
decide to do. Come with me and I will save you,
just as I intend to save myself, from Ramon's
anger. But if you stick to your old master I cannot
say one good word for you when you face the
Mexican authorities. Now I am tired talking.
Make up your minds and let me know."</p>

<p>He carelessly rose, lighted another cigarette
and strolled down to the water's edge, where he
stood with his back to them. The three rascals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
took advantage of the opportunity and argued
among themselves for half an hour.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or!" called Francisco, who, as a trusted
lieutenant of Ramon Ganza, was the more important
of the three.</p>

<p>Mr. Radley-Todd came back to the launch.</p>

<p>"It is this way," explained Francisco. "We
desire to be save, se&ntilde;or, but we have caution. We
believe you speak true, but not yet have you conquer
Ramon; not yet has the warship come to
take him to prison. So we think of a way to be
safe if Ramon win, an' safe if you win. It is but
just to us, as honest men, that we do that way."</p>

<p>Chesty smiled, really amused.</p>

<p>"How childlike and bland you naughty, naughty
men are!" he exclaimed. "But let me hear your
clever plan to play both sides and win hands
down."</p>

<p>"When we find you escape from ship," began
Francisco, "then Ramon think you have come
here, for the tent is gone from the top of the
bluff. So Ramon tell us to come here in big
launch, to see what you do, an' he say capture
you an' bring you back to him. When we get here
we find this boat; but two fly away in air-machine,
an' only one is left to capture. But
Ramon not know if we come before the two fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>away or not; he not know if we three, who come
to capture, get capture ourselves. So that is
what we mus' do. We get capture. You tie up
our arms an' our legs an' put gag in our mouth.
Then you put us in boat an' take us away to your
ship. If Ramon stop us, we say we have been
capture. If Ramon see you take us on your ship,
he think we have fight hard an' been capture, an'
he sorry but not mad. Then, if he take your ship,
he set us free; if warship come an' capture
Ramon, we safe on your ship an' be hones' men,
like you say, an' get reward from Madero. Is it
not good way, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>Chesty's sentiments wavered between indignation
and admiration. Such a combination of low
cunning, cowardice and absence of all shame he
had never encountered in any being of human
origin. But his cue was not to quarrel with the
men at this time. It was enough to realize that
instead of becoming a prisoner he was to carry
his three captors, bound, to the ship, and so
deprive Ramon of that many assistants.</p>

<p>In the outlaw's big launch, which was anchored
just outside the tiny bay in the open sea, were
plenty of stout ropes. Francisco waded out and
got a supply, and then he proceeded deftly to
bind his two comrades, trussing their arms to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
bodies and their legs together, so that they were
helpless. The fellows grinned with delight at this
experience, thinking how cleverly they were fooling
Ramon Ganza, and when they were laid side
by side on the beach Chesty stuck a lighted cigarette
in the mouth of each, to afford them comfort
and render them patient. Then Francisco bound
his own legs and turned to Mr. Radley-Todd, who
at once completed the operation and fastened
Francisco's arms to his body&mdash;not too tightly, but
in a very secure manner.</p>

<p>When this was done the big boy breathed a sigh
of contentment and set himself down beside his
captives.</p>

<p>"Now," said Francisco, "you mus' put us in
big boat an' go back to ship with us."</p>

<p>Chesty shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not yet, old man," said he.</p>

<p>"Not yet?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall wait for night. It will be safe in
the darkness."</p>

<p>"Then you are 'fraid of Ramon?"</p>

<p>"Not much. Just a little."</p>

<p>The prisoners wriggled uneasily.</p>

<p>"Listen, then, Se&ntilde;or American," observed
Francisco. "If we not go before night, then
release our bonds&mdash;make loose the ropes&mdash;so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
will rest more easy. When night come you will
again tie us up."</p>

<p>Mr. Todd was unresponsive.</p>

<p>"Too much trouble, Francisco," he remarked,
with a yawn. "Why do the work twice?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;to lie here all day? San Sebastian, it
is too horrible!"</p>

<p>"Fortunes of war, my dear boy. Ramon might
appear unexpectedly, you know. We made a bargain,
to ensure your safety, and we're going to
keep it."</p>

<p>All three turned their heads to regard him with
interest. There were sparks of glowering resentment
in their dark eyes. Presently one of them
said in humble tones:</p>

<p>"With your kind permission, Se&ntilde;or America&ntilde;o,
I think I will change my mind."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Chesty; "do anything you
please with your mind. It's yours, you know."</p>

<p>"I think, then, se&ntilde;or, I will not be your prisoner&mdash;until
night."</p>

<p>"Don't think any such thing. It's wicked of
you. Try to guide your thoughts into right channels.
Make up your mind to be true to your bargain,
because&mdash;you have to be."</p>

<p>Francisco groaned.</p>

<p>"All masters are cruel," he muttered. "This
America&ntilde;o is as bad as Ramon!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he's going to preserve your liberty and
keep you out of jail," Chesty reminded him.</p>

<p>"And now, boys, try to sleep, for I'm going to
take a little walk and stretch my legs."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />

<small>SCUTTLED</small></h2>


<p>A modicum of truth had been included in Ramon
Ganza's recital of falsehoods during his interview
with those on board the yacht. The outlaw
was really in a tight place and only by forcing,
in some way, the capture of the yacht could he
hope to escape in a manner at all agreeable to his
requirements.</p>

<p>By this time he was fully aware of the situation
that confronted him. The flying-machine, if
it encountered no accident, would reach the mainland
and secure assistance for the stranded
Americans. Perhaps it was true that President
Madero would send a warship to capture him.
Like most fugitive criminals, he had an exaggerated
idea of his own importance. In any event he
must abandon his island kingdom and seek another
hiding place. His first intention&mdash;to make everyone
of these intruders prisoners and subjects, so
they could not betray him&mdash;was frustrated by the
escape of the two in the a&euml;roplane. It would be
useless to capture the others when these two had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
already carried the news to the authorities who
were seeking him.</p>

<p>Two courses of procedure were, open to Ganza.
One was hastily to outfit his sixty-foot launch and
run it to the South Pacific in search of some other
island that was uninhabited, taking with him
enough men and women to start a new colony.
The other was to capture the yacht, put his most
cherished possessions on board and then make off
in it before any help could arrive from the mainland.
The first was by far the most sensible
course, but the beauties of the <i>Salvador</i> had so
enraptured him and he was so well aware of the
value a yacht would prove to him that he could
not bring himself to abandon the idea of securing
it until the last moment of grace had arrived.</p>

<p>This led him to consider how much time
remained to him in which to carry out his intentions.
He figured that at least thirty-six hours
must elapse before any ship could possibly arrive.
It was unlikely that the messengers would find
a ship prepared to sail at a moment's notice, and
therefore three or four days might pass before he
would be disturbed by any outside foe.</p>

<p>Ramon had hoped to frighten the Americans
into surrender and therefore had arranged the
little drama so lately enacted; but the finale had
disappointed him. There was no mine planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
beneath the yacht, but he had instructed one of his
men to answer to his call, no matter what name
he cried out, and to make the statement to the
Americans which he had so cleverly invented. He
made a mistake in thinking the flag of truce would
protect him, for these strangers were not so simple
as he had believed; so he had been forced to
attempt a desperate escape, which succeeded
because it was so bold and unexpected.</p>

<p>Recovering his breath as his white flannels dried
upon the rocks, Ramon Ganza carefully considered
his next move in the game. The yacht was a
glorious prize. He must certainly have it for his
own. The people on board seemed unequal to a
successful defense. There might be half a dozen
determined men among them, but the rest were
women and cowards. He laughed as he recalled
Mr. Tupper's terror at his threats.</p>

<p>The outlaw decided to carry the ship by assault.
A night attack would be best. As soon as Francisco
returned with the launch he would call his
men together and instruct them what to do. Being
informed of every movement on the part of the
besieged, Ganza was aware that three people had
escaped in the small launch to the bluff where the
flying-machine lay. As soon as he discovered that
the tent was gone he had dispatched Francisco
with two men to capture the three, or as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
he could find. When the a&euml;roplane ascended
Ganza watched it carefully and decided it contained
but two people; therefore Francisco would
find the other and presently return.</p>

<p>But Francisco failed to put in an appearance,
to his master's great annoyance. That old tub of
a launch was precious to him, for if all else failed
he must use it to make good his escape. Also he
needed the three men to assist in boarding the
yacht in the night attack. His men were unarmed,
while the yacht's crew seemed well provided with
weapons of defense.</p>

<p>As the day wore on he considered sending the
rowboat to search for Francisco's party, but
decided not to risk it. Of course Francisco would
come, in time; doubtless he was delayed because
he experienced difficulty in capturing his man.</p>

<p>Evening came, but no Francisco. Ramon Ganza
was perplexed; he was even somewhat troubled.
He must defer the attack until the launch arrived,
for he intended to use it to carry his men to the
side of the yacht. His plan was to have the launch
run up to one side and make a noisy attack, to
create a diversion and concentrate the attention
of those on board, while he and a party of picked
men stole silently to the other side in the rowboat,
climbed to the deck and overcame all who opposed
them. The bow was too high to scale, where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
rested on the beach; the attack must be made near
the stern, which sat low in the water.</p>

<p>Therefore the launch was quite necessary, as
were the three men who were absent with it,
so Ramon was angry with Francisco for not
returning more promptly.</p>

<p>The outlaw paced up and down the rocks in the
starlight and cursed his dilatory lieutenant most
heartily.</p>

<p>But the launch was coming. In fact, two
launches were coming to the bay.</p>

<p>As soon as night had really settled down, Mr.
Radley-Todd quit loafing and suddenly became
active. He carried his trussed and helpless prisoners,
one by one, to the small launch and laid
them gently along the bottom. He had already,
during the afternoon, waded out to the larger
launch of Ganza, bored a large hole in its bottom
and then stopped the inrushing water with a plug.
He chuckled while doing this, being greatly
pleased by what he called his "foxy plan to fool
the pirate."</p>

<p>With his prisoners aboard, the boy shoved the
<i>Salvador's</i> launch into the water and cautiously
paddled it between the rocks and to the side of
the big launch, to which he attached it by means
of a rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I shall gag you boys, as you suggested,"
he said to the prisoners, who by this
time had become sullen and decidedly unfriendly.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Francisco, partly in anger and
partly in fear; "it is not necessary. We know
what to do."</p>

<p>"Will you promise not to cry out and attract
Ramon's attention?"</p>

<p>"We swear it!" they all cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Then I think I shall gag you. Not because I
doubt your word but because I've whittled out
three lovely gags and I'm anxious to see how they
work."</p>

<p>They began to protest vigorously at such unkind
treatment, but Chesty gagged them, by turns, and
they were effectually silenced.</p>

<p>"You boys are splendid actors," he told them,
admiringly, "and you are performing your parts
with great credit to us all. No one would guess
this was your plan, would he? Ramon least of all.
If we are not captured, you will make an important
addition to our party on the yacht. If we
are, you will lie gloriously to Ramon and say I
sneaked up behind you and sandbagged all three
before you saw me. Eh? Never mind answering,
for you can't."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Chesty climbed into the big launch
and started the engines. They grumbled and
refused to act, at first, but finally overcame their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
reluctance and the boat chug-chugged on its way
to the south bay, making such a racket that the
owls thought it was defying them and redoubled
their frantic screeches.</p>

<p>"Ramon will be certain to hear me coming,"
reflected the boy as the boat swept on. "He's a
clever scoundrel, that Mexican; exceptionally
clever; but if he guesses this riddle he's a wizard."</p>

<p>He kept the launch well out from the shore and
as it approached the points of rock behind which
the yacht lay hidden he set the steering wheel to
carry the boat a couple of hundred yards past the
entrance to the bay, lashing it firmly in place.
Then, while the engines continued their monotonous
"chug-chug," he pried the plug out of the
bottom of the boat, crept aboard the <i>Salvador's</i>
launch and unfastened the rope, cutting the two
craft apart. The big launch quickly forged ahead
and Chesty sat down and let the smaller boat
drift peacefully where it lay.</p>

<p>Ramon Ganza had heard his boat coming, as
Chesty had intended he should. Greatly relieved,
but still angry with Francisco, he ran as far out
upon the point as the rocks would permit and
peered through the starlight to catch sight of the
approaching launch.</p>

<p>Presently it appeared, making good time, the
old engines working steadily and doing their full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
duty. But it did not turn into the bay, for some
extraordinary reason; instead, it kept straight
on and headed for some indefinite point out at
sea.</p>

<p>"Francisco!" shouted Ganza, in a rage; "Francisco&mdash;villain&mdash;fool!
What are you doing? Wake
up, Francisco! The idiot is asleep."</p>

<p>As the precious launch did not halt, the outlaw
ran along the shore, following its track and shaking
his fist at the perverse Francisco with vengeful
energy. Most of his men, attracted by their
chief's excitement, left their posts to join him on
the shore; the others gazed wonderingly in the
direction of the disappearing launch.</p>

<p>Meantime, Chesty Todd cautiously paddled his
little boat into the bay, crept to the side of the
yacht and uttered a low whistle&mdash;the signal agreed
upon. Those on board, who had been interested
in Ramon's shouts and suspected something was
about to happen, lost no time in lowering the
davits and Chesty promptly attached the grappling
hooks. A few moments later the launch and
its occupants were safely on deck and the boy
stepped out to be greeted by hearty handshakes
and congratulations on his safe return.</p>

<p>"You'll find three prisoners in the launch, Captain
Krell," he said. "When you remove their
gags they'll protest they are our friends; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
wouldn't trust 'em. Better lock 'em in the cage
until this cruel war is over."</p>

<p>"What has become of the Mexican's launch?"
asked Mr. Cumberford. "The pirates seem to
be having some trouble over it."</p>

<p>"It won't bother 'em for long," replied Mr.
Todd, complacently. "The boat is headed out to
sea, all by its lonesome; but there's a hole in the
bottom and it's fast filling with salt water. I
imagine that within the next fifteen minutes it
will go to Davy Jones's locker, and be out of
commission."</p>

<small>ORISSA RETURNS</small></h2>


<p>If ever man was thoroughly perplexed it was
Ramon Ganza the outlaw. He heard his launch
proceed for a distance out to sea, then listened
while the engines hesitated and stopped, and saw
the boat on which his liberty might depend whirl
slowly around and disappear beneath the waves.
What could it mean? Were his men on board,
and had they met with some astonishing accident,
or had they deliberately committed suicide? The
curses died on his lips; the affair was too startling
and too serious for mere raving; he must try
to think of a logical solution of the problem.</p>

<p>The loss of the launch, his last refuge from captivity
and imprisonment, left him caught like a
wolf in a trap&mdash;in case he failed to get possession
of the yacht. All night long he sat on a rock by
the sea, smoking his black cheroots and thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking.
Neither he nor his men
knew that Chesty Todd had returned to the yacht;
but if Ramon had known it he would not have
attached especial importance to the fact. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
would merely mean one more person to capture
during the assault.</p>

<p>Morning found Ganza still deep in thought. He
glanced rather uneasily at the ocean and at times
swept the horizon with his glasses, which were
slung by a strap to his shoulder. His men brought
him food and a cup of hot coffee, but dared not
speak to him in his present mood. They suspected
his case was growing desperate, yet they
still retained confidence in their resourceful,
clever master, who had never yet failed to
accomplish whatever he undertook.</p>

<p>In this crisis of his career the fugitive, usually
irritable and quick to act, proved his strength of
mind by taking time to consider his position from
all points and to weigh carefully the merits of the
different plans that suggested themselves. He
realized that an error at this time would prove
fatal.</p>

<p>The hours wore on until, at about the middle
of the afternoon, as Ganza made one of his
periodic inspections of the horizon, his glasses
caught a speck in the sky&mdash;a speck that moved
and grew larger. At first he thought it a gull
or an eagle; later he changed his mind, for the
speck rapidly increased in size and took form, and
the form was that of an a&euml;roplane.</p>

<p>Those on the yacht saw it now and great was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the wonder and excitement it caused. Here was
a messenger from the great world, bringing them
hope of succor or black disappointment. Presently
the broad spreading planes bore down upon
the island and circled gracefully over the ship.</p>

<p>"It's Orissa!" they cried in chorus and Chesty
Todd added: "She wants to land on deck. Clear
a space&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>They did the best they could. It seemed like a
tiny place for that great sweeping thing to land
on and even Sybil exclaimed: "She'll never make
it in the world!" But Orissa, hovering above
them in her Aircraft, observed carefully the conditions
below and shutting off her engine began
to volplane.</p>

<p>The huge machine settled quietly down and
alighted fairly upon the deck. One rail caught
the lower plane and tipped it, but the girl leaped
lightly from her seat and was caught by Mr. Cumberford,
whose gray eyes sparkled with joy from
behind their spectacles.</p>

<p>You may be sure the brave girl received a glad
welcome, but as soon as her safety was assured
she was deluged with questions. The ping of a
rifle ball warned them to scuttle below to the cabin,
where Orissa tried to explain.</p>

<p>"Why on earth did you venture to come back?"
demanded Madeline. "We had told ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
that you, at least, were safe from the dangers
that menace us, and it pleased us to know that.
But where is your brother?"</p>

<p>"Did you get to land?" cried half a dozen
voices, eagerly. "What did you do? Tell us!"</p>

<p>Orissa laughed and held up both hands, imploring
silence.</p>

<p>"I came to bring you good news," she began.
"And now that you are assured of that, please
let me tell the story my own way, or I shall
bungle it."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," they answered and settled themselves
to listen.</p>

<p>"We followed the route Captain Krell had
mapped out for us," said Orissa, "and in four
hours after leaving here we sighted the Mexican
coast. Fifteen minutes' run to the north brought
us to the village of San Blas, where there is a
telegraph office. We landed and had some difficulty
in satisfying the authorities that we were
harmless Americans, but finally they agreed to
escort us to the telegraph office under guard. We
wired our story direct to President Madero, putting
it as briefly as possible and asking him for a
warship to rescue our friends and capture Ramon
Ganza. There was no answer until evening, when
we received a message from the Secretary of the
Navy saying he had conferred with the President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and Secretary of State and would be glad to
accede to our request. In eight or ten days he
thought he could spare a warship to go to the
island for Ganza. Unfortunately, the entire navy
was in use at the present time.</p>

<p>"That dashed our hopes, you may be sure, for
we feared you couldn't hold Ganza at bay for so
long; so Steve and I determined to fly to San
Diego and secure help there. The Secretary of
the Navy had wired the authorities of San Blas
to afford us every consideration and hospitality,
so we filled our tanks with gasoline and slept at
a little inn until daybreak. Then we were off for
the north, and in two hours met the United States
torpedo fleet, on its way to Magdalena Bay for
target practice. We made out the flagship and
dropped to the water beside it. Commodore Davis
at once laid to and sent a boat to us. Steve went
aboard and explained fully to the commodore our
story and the need for immediate help. As a
result the <i>Mermaid</i> was signaled and its captain
presently came aboard and received his orders.
He was to take us directly to this island, drive
off Ganza or fight him, as circumstances might
require, and then assist in getting the <i>Salvador</i>
afloat again. If he captures Ganza he is to carry
him away a prisoner and turn him and his men
over to the Mexican authorities at Magdalena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Swanson undertook the adventure
gladly and is now on his way here with the <i>Mermaid</i>,
with Steve to guide him. My brother and I
thought it best for me to come on ahead and tell
you the good news, for we have worried about you
and knew that with rescue at hand you would
have courage to hold out, no matter how desperate
your condition. So here I am, and the <i>Mermaid</i>
will arrive either to-night or early in the
morning."</p>

<p>They were indeed delighted with this assurance
and it put new heart into the most timorous of
those aboard.</p>

<p>"However," said Chesty Todd, "we seem to be
in no danger, just now, and since our clever enemy
has failed to scare us into surrender he has
remained quiet and behaved himself as well as
could be expected."</p>

<p>They told Orissa all that had transpired in her
absence and the conversation continued all during
the dinner&mdash;on which the chef exercised his best
talents, in honor of Orissa's return&mdash;and even
until bedtime, there was so much to say.</p>

<p>Chesty went on watch at eleven o'clock, and as
he leaned silently over the rail at a point near
the bow of the launch he detected a series of queer
sounds coming from below. This part of the
yacht was high on the shelving beach and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
here that they had arranged huge piles of rock,
on either side, to hold the keel level. It sounded
to Mr. Todd as if some one was at work near these
rocks, for on account of the swell of the boat's
side it was impossible to see, from the deck,
anyone below, in case he kept close to the keel.</p>

<p>So Chesty crept aft, held a whispered conversation
with Captain Krell, and quickly divested
himself of his clothing. At the stern, which was
settled quite close to the surface of the water, the
boy let himself down by means of a rope, descending
hand under hand, and silently dropped into
the dark water. Swimming was one of Radley-Todd's
principal accomplishments and he scarcely
made a ripple as he crept alongside the boat until
the bow came into full view. The night was somewhat
darker than usual, but the American had
sharp eyes and it did not take him long to discover
that the besiegers were employed in removing
the rocks from the right hand side of the keel.</p>

<p>Instantly comprehending their purpose in this,
Chesty turned and quickly regained the stern,
climbing to the deck. His report to Captain
Krell seemed so serious, because it meant a desperate
attack presently, that it was promptly
decided to arouse the entire party and warn them
that a crisis was at hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />

<small>FACING THE CRISIS</small></h2>


<p>Consternation reigned in the cabin when
the principals assembled there with white and
startled faces. On deck Captain Krell was
instructing his men how to act in the threatened
emergency. Pietro was among them, accepting
his rifle and his instructions willingly, but shaking
his head at what he considered a vain attempt
to resist Ramon Ganza.</p>

<p>"Ramon great man!" he said to Captain Krell.
"Ramon always win; nobody can conquer him.
I knew Ramon would win this time, an' when he
does he will capture me an' whip me hard. All
right; I know I am to be whipped at the time
Chica tell me to leave Ramon. Never min'.
Pietro can stand it, for others have been whipped
by Ramon an' lived&mdash;with marks like a zebra's
on their skins."</p>

<p>In the cabin Chesty was trying to explain the
situation.</p>

<p>"It's this way," he said; "when the rocks are
all removed the yacht will fall over on her side, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
she was at first, with the rail quite near to the
water. You remember how she lay before we
propped her up. Well, that means we have no
secure footing on deck and that the pirates can
easily climb aboard and have the best of the
argument. If we slip, we fall into their arms; if
we stick to the deck&mdash;like flies to a ceiling, they'll
rush and get us."</p>

<p>"We can't fight from the deck," declared
Cumberford. "Tell Captain Krell to come here."</p>

<p>The captain arrived and after a consultation it
was decided to gather all hands in the cabin and
fortify it as strongly as possible. The roof projected
a few feet above the deck and there was a
row of small windows on either side, but these
were supplied with heavy shutters designed for
use in case of storms, when the shutters were
readily fixed in place. The stairway might be
well guarded by one man, and above the windows
were small ventilators through which several
rifles could be pointed. By standing upon the
cabin table the defenders could command the deck
in this way. They were instructed not to shoot,
however, unless absolutely obliged to. All the
hatches were battened down, so that if Ganza
gained the deck he could not get below and was
welcome to remain aboard until the rescuers
arrived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>Orissa, who had listened silently, now approached
Mr. Cumberford and said:</p>

<p>"When the yacht tips, our Aircraft will be
ruined, for the chances are it will slide overboard.
Even if it doesn't, those scoundrels will
wreck it completely, for it will be quite at their
mercy. So I've decided, while there is yet time,
to fly it across to the bluff, where I can remain
until you are rescued."</p>

<p>"Can you manage to get away from the deck?"</p>

<p>"Easily."</p>

<p>"Then I think it best for you to go."</p>

<p>"May I take Sybil with me?"</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment; then replied: "Yes.
It will be a good thing to have you girls away
from here when the attack is made. Here you
could be of no service whatever, and your absence
will&mdash;eh&mdash;give us more room to defend the cabin."</p>

<p>"You will have to act quickly, Miss Kane,"
suggested Chesty.</p>

<p>"I know. Come, Sybil."</p>

<p>They drew on their jackets as they went on
deck, both girls realizing that no time must be
lost if they hoped to get away. Once the yacht
tipped on her side it would be impossible to fly
the machine.</p>

<p>As they took their places Mr. Radley-Todd
inquired: "Plenty of gasoline?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so," said Orissa. "I'm not sure how
much is left in the tanks, but it ought to be enough
to get us to the bluff. Whirl the propeller,
Chesty."</p>

<p>He did so, and the engine started with a roar.
Cumberford and Chesty steadied the Aircraft
until the motor had acquired full speed and then
Orissa threw in the clutch and the big a&euml;roplane
rose as easily as a bird takes flight and ascended
into the starlit sky at a steep angle. This feat
is what is called "cloud climbing" and Orissa
understood it perfectly.</p>

<p>It seemed a bold thing to undertake such a
flight in the nighttime, but the Flying Girl's
friends had so much confidence in her skill that
they never considered the danger of the undertaking.
Across the barren island to the bluff
was so unimportant a flight to one of Orissa's
experience that when she was once away they
believed her quite safe.</p>

<p>While the men stood watching the Aircraft
mount into the dim sky the yacht suddenly
trembled and keeled over, throwing them all flat
upon the deck. With one accord they scrambled
up and dashed into the cabin, which they reached
just as Ramon Ganza and his men swarmed over
the rail.</p>

<small>THE PRISONER</small></h2>


<p>"What's wrong, Ris?" asked Sybil, as the
engine skipped and wavered.</p>

<p>"Gasoline," was the brief answer.</p>

<p>"Oh. Can you get to the bluff?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know. There!" as the propeller
ceased to whirl; "now I'll volplane. It's a long
reach, Syb; but we'll land somewhere&mdash;right side
up."</p>

<p>The dim mountain seemed far ahead of them;
below was the "dip," or valley, which lay between
the rock ridges and the mountain. As they had
casually glanced toward it in former times, it
seemed a forbidding place, slimy and moist, devoid
alike of any green thing or living creature. Even
the owls shunned the "dip."</p>

<p>To-night, when everything was obscure, they
seemed gliding into a black pit. Orissa had to
manipulate her levers cautiously, for she could
not tell just when they would reach the ground.
As it was they bumped, bounded forward, bumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
again and brought up suddenly between two
boulders that topped a rugged knoll.</p>

<p>"Any damage?" asked Sybil, catching her
breath.</p>

<p>"Not much, I'm sure," replied her chum. "But
here we are; and here we'll stay until some one
comes with gasoline. Can you see anything,
Syb?"</p>

<p>"The mountain, over there against the sky. It
seems so near I could almost touch it. It wouldn't
have taken but a few drops more to have landed
us on the bluff, drat the luck!"</p>

<p>"See anything else?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Around us."</p>

<p>"No; but I can smell something. Smells like
spoiled gasoline. Does gasoline ever spoil, Ris?"</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge. But come; let's crawl
into the boat and get the blankets out. Wherever
we are, it's our hotel, and we must make the best
of it."</p>

<p>Skyward, there could be distinguished the mountain
at the west and the rock hills at the east;
but the pocket in which they lay was black as ink.
From the boat Orissa managed to open the aluminum
chest and take out the blankets. They then
arranged a temporary bed in the bottom of the
boat and covered themselves up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, I managed to save the Aircraft,"
sighed Orissa, contentedly. Then she sat bolt
upright and cried: "Listen!"</p>

<p>"The battle's on," answered Sybil, as a succession
of wild shouts reached their ears. It was
very aggravating to be so ignorant of what was
happening to their friends. The shouts continued,
at intervals, but there was no sound of firearms.
Evidently the Mexicans had gained the deck but
had found it a barren victory. On the mountain
the owls were hooting and flying about as usual,
but the shouts that had come from the bay were of
such a different nature that the shrieks of the
night-birds did not drown them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a broad streak of light shot over them,
rested a moment on the mountain, swayed to right
and left and then sank below the ridges of rock.
Above the bay where the <i>Salvador</i> was beached
thin shafts of white light radiated, illuminating
the sky like an aurora borealis.</p>

<p>"A searchlight!"</p>

<p>"The torpedo boat!" the girls cried in one
breath; and then they sat trembling and straining
their ears to listen.</p>

<p>A dull, angry "boom!" rent the air and echoed
from the mountain. It was a warning gun from
the <i>Mermaid</i>. The shouts became screams of fear.
Then silence followed, complete and enduring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Orissa breathed heavily. "It's all over, Sybil!"
she gasped.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wonder if&mdash;anyone was&mdash;hurt."</p>

<p>"Any of our people?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I think not. That gun was merely a signal
and I imagine the Mexicans ran like rats. How
fortunate it was that Captain Swanson arrived
with the <i>Mermaid</i> so soon!"</p>

<p>"How unfortunate he didn't come sooner. We
wouldn't have been in this awkward predicament.
It will take them hours to get to us over those
sharp rocks."</p>

<p>Orissa did not reply. She was trying to understand
the events transpiring around the <i>Salvador</i>.
Had there been a tragedy? Or had the torpedo
boat merely frightened the outlaws, as she had
imagined, and driven them away?</p>

<p>There was no sleep for the isolated girls during
the brief hours preceding the dawn. As it gradually
lightened they peered about them to see
where they were, and by degrees made out their
surroundings. There were fewer rocks in this
cup-shaped hollow than in other parts of the
island. On the knoll where the Aircraft rested
were the two big rocks which had arrested its
progress, and between these the body of the aluminum
boat was tightly wedged. At intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
throughout the valley were similar rocky hummocks,
but all the space between consisted of an
oozy, damp soil of a greenish-brown color, with
glints of red where the sun caught it prismatically.
Looking at this ooze critically, as the light
strengthened, it seemed to the girls to shift somewhat,
showing here and there a thick bubble
which slowly formed and disappeared.</p>

<p>Orissa put her hand over the side of the boat
and withdrew it again.</p>

<p>"Look, Sybil," she exclaimed. "It's oil."</p>

<p>"Hair or salad oil, Ris?"</p>

<p>Orissa sniffed at her dipped finger.</p>

<p>"Petroleum. This is the crude article, and seeps
up from some store of oil far down in the earth.
There would be a fortune in this find, Syb, if it
happened to be in America. Out here it is, of
course, valueless."</p>

<p>"Don't they make kerosene and gasoline of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; of course."</p>

<p>"Then make some gasoline and let's fly away."</p>

<p>Orissa laughed.</p>

<p>"If you will furnish the distillery, Syb, I'll
make the gasoline," she said; "but I believe it's
a long, slow process, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Sybil, with a start, as she pointed
a slim finger toward the east. From a far distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>ridge a man came bounding over the rocks, leaping
from one to another with little hesitation in
picking his way. He was a big man, but as the
light was still dim they could see no more than
his huge form. Presently he paused to look
behind him; then on he dashed again. He had
come from the direction of the bay and was at
first headed toward the mountain, but in one of
his pauses, whether to regain his breath or look
behind, he caught sight of the a&euml;roplane and at
once turned directly toward it.</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Sybil, uneasily, "it is
one of our people come to look for us?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Orissa, positively. "That man
is a fugitive. He has escaped over the rock hills
and is trying to find some hiding place."</p>

<p>"Then I wonder he dares come in our direction."</p>

<p>"It is <i>strange</i>," agreed Orissa, with a shudder
as she remembered how helpless they were.</p>

<p>Then, with fascinated gaze, the two girls fell
silent and watched the approaching fugitive. As
he neared that part of the valley where the oil
seeped up he proceeded more cautiously, leaping
from one point of rock&mdash;or hummock&mdash;to another.
Once, when forced to step on the level ground, the
oil tripped him. He slipped and fell, but was
instantly up again and bounding on his way. It
seemed no easy task to make speed over such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
rough and trackless way, yet here it was easier
to proceed than back in those almost impassable
hills. It was wonderful that he had succeeded in
crossing them at all.</p>

<p>"I think," said Orissa, as she sat cold and staring,
"it is Ramon Ganza."</p>

<p>"The outlaw? But he wears white flannels."</p>

<p>"Not now. He probably changed them for the
night attack; but I can see the rings glitter on his
fingers, and&mdash;none of the other Mexicans is so
big."</p>

<p>Sybil nestled a little closer to her friend.</p>

<p>"Have you a revolver, Ris?"</p>

<p>Orissa shook her head.</p>

<p>"No arms at all&mdash;not even a hatpin?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever to use for defense."</p>

<p>The man was quite near now. Yes; it was
Ramon Ganza. His clothes were torn by the rocks
and hung around him in rags, and where he had
fallen the thick, slimy oil clung to them. His face
was smeared with dust and grime and the whole
aspect of the outlaw was ghastly and repulsive&mdash;perhaps
rendered more acute by the jewelled
rings that loaded his fingers.</p>

<p>He was obliged to step with more care as he
neared the a&euml;roplane, in which crouched the two
girls, and finally he came to a halt on a hummock
a few paces away. The oil lay more thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
around the Aircraft than elsewhere, and Ramon
Ganza eyed it suspiciously. Then he spoke, resting
his hands on his hips and leering insolently
at Sybil and Orissa.</p>

<p>"So, I have caught you, then," he cried. "Why
did you try to escape?"</p>

<p>"For the same reason you are trying to escape,
perhaps," retorted Orissa, summoning what courage
she could command. "But I warn you that
our friends will presently come for us, and&mdash;you
may not care to meet them."</p>

<p>He uttered an angry snarl and cast a quick
glance around the valley. In all its broad stretch
not a person other than themselves was visible.</p>

<p>Ramon sat down on his knoll, breathing heavily
from his long run.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have run away," he admitted, bitterness
and hate in his tone. "I can fight ten&mdash;or
twenty, perhaps&mdash;with my single hand; but not
fifty. They have come to put me in prison, those
fiends over there," jerking his thumb toward the
bay, "and seeing they were too strong for me to
oppose, I came away. It is what you call discreet&mdash;eh?&mdash;which
is more safe, if less noble, than
valor. But they have the island and they will
hunt me down. And once more I shall laugh at
them&mdash;once more Ramon Ganza will defy them
all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" asked Orissa, curiously.</p>

<p>"Have you not the flying-machine&mdash;the airship?"
he asked, simply. "And are you not here
alone, and in my power? It carries but two, I see,
so one of you shall stay here. The other must
fly with me to my own island, where I will take
a sailboat and&mdash;vanish from the dogs who are
hounding me."</p>

<p>"That," said Orissa, with forced calmness, for
her heart was beating wildly, "is impossible."</p>

<p>He uttered a fierce growl.</p>

<p>"It is <i>not</i> impossible," he cried. "I have seen
your machine fly, and know it can fly when you
want it to. It must fly now, or by San Filippe I
will tumble you both out and fly it myself. It is
best that you not arouse my anger, for Ramon
Ganza is desperate and will not be denied. Get
ready, girl! We will fly to my island, or&mdash;&mdash;"
He laughed harshly. "Or you will both ruin your
beautiful toilets, and&mdash;the mire is dangerous,"
he added.</p>

<p>"We have no gasoline," pleaded Orissa.</p>

<p>"Pah! a trick to deceive me."</p>

<p>"No; it is true," cried Sybil, who grew more
quiet as fear possessed her.</p>

<p>He hesitated, a look of despair flashing across
his features. Then he said with grim determination:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>"I will see for myself," and stepped recklessly
into the pool of oil that lay between him and
the hummock where the a&euml;roplane perched.</p>

<p>The slime reached to his ankle, but he kept doggedly
on. The second step sent him knee-deep into
the ooze and he had to struggle to wade farther
in. But now he sank nearly to his waist and the
sticky soil held him fast. Then suddenly the man
seemed to realize his peril and uttered a shrill
cry of terror.</p>

<p>"Help, young ladies! For the love of humanity&mdash;help!
Will you see me die like this?" he
screamed.</p>

<p>Orissa and Sybil, both horrified, had risen to
their feet. The sinking outlaw was fully five
yards distant and there seemed no possible way
to aid him. But it was terrible to allow a human
being to perish in such a way, even when it was a
confessed enemy who stood in peril. Orissa caught
up a blanket and hurled it toward him, and he
seized it eagerly and spread it around him for
support. Next moment Sybil had hastily folded
the second blanket and cast it with all her strength
toward Ganza. One corner he caught and in a
moment had added it to the first, now becoming
saturated with oil. Yet the blankets would not
have availed much had not Ramon's feet now
rested upon a rock far beneath the surface, effectually
preventing him from sinking any lower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Almost waist-deep in the putty-like mire he stood
a fast prisoner, for no effort of his own could
enable him to free himself.</p>

<p>He realized, presently, that he was not fated to
be entombed in the mire, so part of his old assurance
returned to him. As he stared at the girls
and they returned his gaze with horrified looks,
he remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, I am caught, as you see; but it was no
officer of the law that did it. Ramon Ganza can
defy mankind, as he has often proved, but he bows
to Nature. Also, young ladies, I beg to point
out that&mdash;if you have spoken truly&mdash;you are likewise
caught, and alas! we cannot assist one
another. What, then, shall we do for amusement?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Sybil gravely, "you ought to
pray."</p>

<p>"I? I have forgotten how. What then? Shall
we sing songs? If you will accompany the chorus
I will delight your ears with my excellent tenor
voice."</p>

<p>This bravado, coming from a man stuck fast in
the mire, was so gruesome that it made the girls
shudder with aversion. But Sybil, happening to
glance up, cried with sudden animation: "Look,
Orissa!" and pointed with a trembling finger.</p>

<p>In the distance a group of men had appeared
over the edge of the rock hills. They saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the stalled a&euml;roplane and waved their arms
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Ganza screwed his head around with some difficulty
and also observed the rescue party.</p>

<p>"It cannot matter," he said coolly. "As well
one prison as another, and no Mexican dungeon
could hug me tighter than this."</p>

<p>He fell silent, however, and no further remarks
were exchanged as the distant party drew nearer.
They were forced by the treacherous nature of
the valley to move cautiously and when they
entered the area of oil seepage more than one
slipped in the slimy pools. But gradually they
approached the spot where the a&euml;roplane rested
and now Orissa and Sybil could make out Stephen
Kane, Mr. Cumberford, Captain Krell, Chesty
Todd and an unknown man in uniform, who were
accompanied by several seamen.</p>

<p>The girls stood up and waved their handkerchiefs
and then cried out warnings to beware the
mire. Not until the rescuers were quite near to
the place did they perceive the upper half of
Ramon Ganza protruding from the imprisoning
slime.</p>

<p>"Dear me," cried Mr. Cumberford; "this is
interesting; very! How are you, girls? All
right?"</p>

<p>Through the bombardment of eager questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
they assured their friends that they had suffered
no serious discomfort because of the accident to
the Aircraft. "But," added Sybil, "we had a
good fright when Ramon Ganza threatened us,
unless we assisted him to escape in our a&euml;roplane.
Fortunately the mire came to our assistance, for
he stepped into a soft place and it held him fast&mdash;as
you see."</p>

<p>All eyes turned upon the helpless outlaw, who
nodded his head with astonishing nonchalance.</p>

<p>"I bid you good morning, se&ntilde;ors," said he.
"When you are sufficiently rested from your walk,
be kind enough to pull me out of this loving
embrace; but gently, or you may dislocate my
bones."</p>

<p>"Who is this?" asked the officer in uniform, a
fine featured young man.</p>

<p>"The rascal who has so boldly annoyed us,
regardless of consequences," replied Cumberford,
frowning upon the Mexican. "He escaped us last
night, but we have him now, sure enough, and I
intend to see he is handed over to the authorities
of his country, whose laws he has defied."</p>

<p>"What did he do?" the officer inquired, gazing
at Ganza curiously.</p>

<p>"Permit me to explain that I robbed a bank&mdash;a
bank engaged in robbing others under government
sanction," said Ganza. "To rob is a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
thing, se&ntilde;ors; but it is a crime to be discovered
robbing. That was my fault. Others in my native
land, who are more successful embezzlers than I,
are to-day respected, rich and happy."</p>

<p>"Was that your only crime?"</p>

<p>"So far as is known, se&ntilde;or. Otherwise I am
very good man and quite respectable."</p>

<p>"He is a tyrant and a bully, and whips his men
if they disobey him," declared Steve.</p>

<p>"Pah! they are curs. The whip is less than
they deserve," retorted Ganza. "But permit me
to remind you of my present discomfort, se&ntilde;ors.
I will gladly exchange this bog for a Mexican
prison."</p>

<p>They managed to drag him out, none too gently,
and the seamen scraped the oily slime from his
legs and body so that he could stand erect.</p>

<p>Then they turned to examine the condition of
the a&euml;roplane.</p>

<small>ORISSA DECIDES</small></h2>


<p>Only by taking the Aircraft entirely apart,
decided Steve, might he hope to remove it to the
bay, for it could not be flown from the hummock
where it was wedged between the rocks. But they
could not wait to do that now. The girls were
very near one of those feminine crises so familiar
to Mrs. Tupper, and their friends realized the
nervous strain they had endured and made haste
to lead them back to the yacht. The seamen looked
after Ramon Ganza, who was so physically
exhausted by his late experience that he made no
endeavor to escape.</p>

<p>It was a tedious climb, by no means devoid of
danger, but so anxious were Orissa and Sybil to
escape from the dread valley that they energetically
persevered until the last rock hill was passed
and they descended the slope to the inlet.</p>

<p>There lay the <i>Salvador</i>; keeled over, indeed,
but safe and sound. Just without the bay floated
the <i>Mermaid</i>, and one of her boats was run upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the beach and another clung to the <i>Salvador's</i>
side.</p>

<p>A hearty cheer greeted the return of the rescue
party when Orissa and Sybil were observed
approaching with them, and Captain Swanson
himself came forward to offer his congratulations.</p>

<p>On their way, Steve had briefly related the
events of the night attack and told how the
defenders, fortified within the cabin and below
decks, had been quite safe from Ganza until the
arrival of the torpedo boat relieved the situation.
Then the Mexicans fled and made frantic attempts
to escape, hiding themselves in the wilderness of
rocks that littered the island.</p>

<p>When Captain Swanson learned of the capture
of Ramon Ganza and the rescue of the young
ladies he decided to attempt no pursuit of the scattered
Mexicans but to apply himself promptly to
the task of floating the yacht, which he succeeded
in doing before night. The <i>Salvador</i> was in no
way injured and as soon as she had anchored
outside the bay was again in commission and fully
able to care for herself.</p>

<p>Madeline invited the officers of the <i>Mermaid</i> to
dine aboard her yacht and Monsieur Risette prepared
a repast that surprised even his employer,
so elaborate and delicious it proved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>As they conversed together afterward, commenting
upon the exciting experiences of the
yacht and her company and the daring flights of
the Kane Hydro-Aircraft, Madeline said to Captain
Swanson:</p>

<p>"What shall we do with Ramon Ganza?"</p>

<p>"Where is he, Miss Dentry?"</p>

<p>"Locked up in our cage. But I don't want him
aboard. Won't you take him to Magdalena and
turn him over to the Mexican police?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure I have authority to arrest the
man," replied the captain gravely. "I will send
a wireless to the fleet to-night and endeavor to
get the admiral and receive his instructions concerning
Ganza."</p>

<p>He wrote out a message at once and dispatched
it to his ship by one of his men, that the wireless
operator aboard might repeat it a number of times
in the attempt to reach the ship for which it was
intended. A wireless message travels farther by
night and is more distinct.</p>

<p>Madeline now urged Captain Swanson to carry
Chica and Pietro to Magdalena, which would
enable them to reach their homes quickly and he
agreed to do this. Miss Dentry supplied the two
with sufficient money for their needs and the Red-beard
and the child said their good-byes and were
rowed to the <i>Mermaid</i>.</p>

<p>The yacht party, now reunited and safe from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
further molestation, thoroughly enjoyed the evening
and expressed their gratitude again and
again for the prompt assistance rendered them
by their fellow countrymen. Madeline had already
written a nice letter to the admiral, which she
entrusted to Captain Swanson.</p>

<p>As Orissa and Sybil, as well as many others of
the party, had passed a trying and sleepless night,
the officers thoughtfully retired early, returning
to their quarters on the <i>Mermaid</i>.</p>

<p>Breakfast was in progress on the <i>Salvador</i> next
morning when a note was brought from the captain
of the torpedo boat.</p>

<p>"I was fortunate in reaching the admiral," it
said, "and I beg to enclose you a copy of the
message I have received from him in reply. I
further regret to state that I am ordered to rejoin
the fleet without delay and must therefore bid you
all adieu."</p>

<p>The wireless read: "President Madero proclaimed
a general amnesty to Mexican refugees
some three months ago. On the list of pardons
appears the name of Ramon Ganza."</p>

<p>Madeline drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that," she said. "Ramon
Ganza has escaped the penalty of breaking his
country's laws and we are powerless to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
him ourselves&mdash;even though he struck poor Mason
with a knife."</p>

<p>"How is Mason getting along?" asked Orissa.</p>

<p>"Very nicely," stated Mr. Cumberford. "It
was a deep cut, but reached no vital organs and
the man will soon be as good as new."</p>

<p>"That does not alter the fact that Ganza is a
wicked desperado," said Sybil.</p>

<p>"It's a shame to allow him to escape," exclaimed
Mr. Tupper, indignantly. "Can't we
arrest him for disturbing the peace, and trying
to capture our yacht, and attempting to murder
one of the crew?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Cumberford. "This island
doesn't belong to the United States. I believe it
is Mexican territory. But if we can prove damages
we might be able to recover from the Mexican
government&mdash;and then, again, we might not."</p>

<p>"I'll never put in a claim, for my part," said
Madeline, laughing. "But what are we to do with
Ramon Ganza&mdash;and those three rascals imprisoned
with him, whom Chesty captured and brought
to us?"</p>

<p>"Let Chesty get rid of them; they're his prisoners,"
suggested Sybil.</p>

<p>"The chief bandit is your own prisoner&mdash;and
Orissa's," declared Chesty. "What do you intend
to do with him, Miss Cumberford?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Sybil laughed.</p>

<p>"It's a problem," she confessed. "Can you
solve it, Miss Dentry?"</p>

<p>"I fear not," answered Madeline, indeed puzzled.
"Our prisoners are likely to prove white
elephants on our hands. To carry them to
America would involve us in endless difficulties,
and&mdash;I have other plans, wherein their presence
is better dispensed with."</p>

<p>"Then," said Chesty, after due reflection, "let
us leave them all behind us, on the island. Not
this island, where they would be prisoners and
perhaps starve, because I have sunk their gasoline
launch and they cannot get away, but on
Ramon Ganza's own island. Then the fellow may
decide his future as he deems best and we may
wash our hands of the whole disagreeable affair."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't inform him that he is pardoned,"
said Mr. Tupper, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Madeline. "Let us return
good for evil. Perhaps, when Ramon Ganza is no
longer a refugee and can face the world a free
man, he will redeem his past and become honest."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," declared Mr. Cumberford; "but
I think you are right to give him the chance."</p>

<p>It was so decided. There remained on Owl
Island but one of Ganza's rowboats which would
be available for use by the men hidden among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the rocks, but at the larger island was a small
sailboat in which, during calm weather, the chief
might go for his men and transport them to their
former quarters.</p>

<p>Next morning a party accompanied Steve into
the valley once more, where the Aircraft was
taken apart and brought with considerable labor
to the bay, from whence it was conveyed to the
yacht and compactly stored away below decks.</p>

<p>"There's no use putting it together until we
get back home," said the inventor; and his partner,
Mr. Cumberford, agreed with him.</p>

<p>This task had consumed the entire day, during
which Orissa and Sybil had kept to their state-rooms,
trying to quiet their nerves and get some
much-needed sleep. Madeline, in the meantime,
had ordered a store of provisions placed on the
beach for the use of the band of Mexicans until
they were rescued by their leader, as she did not
wish them to suffer for lack of food, however mischievous
and lawless they might be.</p>

<p>The following day Captain Krell hoisted anchor
and headed for the larger island, and it was good
to all to feel the water slipping along underneath
the <i>Salvador's</i> thin keel again.</p>

<p>Ramon Ganza accepted his liberty with the same
stoical indifference that characterized all his
actions. He strutted a bit when Chesty told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
of his pardon, but declared he would continue to
inhabit the island where he was virtually a king.</p>

<p>"With no fear of a prison to haunt me," he
said, "I can make the island a paradise. Many
Mexicans will settle there and become my subjects."</p>

<p>"You'll have to cut out the flogging, then,"
suggested Chesty.</p>

<p>"It will gratify me to do so. Before, I have
the obligation to flog the disobedient ones because
I dared not send them away; but now, if they
prove obstinate, I may send them back to Mexico."</p>

<p>He took off his hat with an elaborate bow as
the <i>Salvador's</i> boat left him standing with his
three men on the little dock below his residence;
but Francisco and the other two scowled fiercely
at Mr. Todd, whom they reproached for deceiving
them about Madero's reward, although they had
elected to remain with their old master rather
than be taken to America.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for civilization that those
villains are sequestrated on a far-away, unknown
island," remarked Chesty, when he had regained
the yacht's deck. "I suppose anyone can reform,
if he tries hard, but I'll bet a hat that Francisco
and his comrades never make the attempt."</p>

<p>"We are well rid of them, in any event,"
asserted Mr. Cumberford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Orissa and Sybil appeared at dinner, both considerably
improved in spirits after their long rest.</p>

<p>"When do we sail for San Diego?" Sybil asked
Madeline.</p>

<p>"Captain Krell is ready. I am waiting for
Orissa and you to decide," was the reply.</p>

<p>Orissa looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"What have we to decide?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Merely which way we shall proceed. My yacht
hasn't had a fair trial yet and I had in mind a
trip to Honolulu before we went in chase of two
runaway girls. We still have on board enough
coal and supplies for such a trip and I have
resolved to invite you all to make it in my company&mdash;in
which case we will head directly for
Hawaii from here."</p>

<p>Orissa was thoughtful for a time and looked
inquiringly at Steve, who smiled in return.</p>

<p>"I think such a trip would do us all good," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"The Flying Girl has no important engagements,
at present," added Mr. Todd, the press
agent.</p>

<p>"If she had, I think she deserves a little recreation
after her late trying experiences," said Mr.
Cumberford.</p>

<p>"Why, Orissa, it has all been decided in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
advance," exclaimed Sybil. "They're merely asking
our consent out of politeness."</p>

<p>Orissa turned to Madeline and pressed her hand
gratefully.</p>

<p>"You've really been our guardian angel, Miss
Dentry," she said. "We can never repay your
great kindness and generosity, nor properly thank
you for what you have done for us."</p>

<p>"Why should you?" asked Madeline. "Think
what a splendid time I've had during this adventure,
all due to the Flying Girl and her chum&mdash;and
to a defect in the famous Kane Aircraft. But if
you sincerely wish to please me, come with me on
the trip to Honolulu."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," Orissa responded. "I've
always longed for an ocean voyage, and in such
company, and on the dear old <i>Salvador</i>, the trip
will be delightful."</p>

<p>The others of the Kane-Cumberford party, who
were every one eager to go, rapturously applauded
this decision.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
